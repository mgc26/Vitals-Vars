# Prior Authorization Provider Issue - Development Notes

## Status
- Created: 2025-01-18
- Stage: ðŸš§ PLANNING
- Target: Issue #04 for Jan 31, 2025
- Series: Part 1 of 2 (Provider perspective)

## Key Angles - Provider Perspective

### The Unique Hook
- First of a two-part series
- "Know thy enemy" - understanding payer thinking
- Taking control of what you CAN control

### Provider Pain Points to Address
1. **The 20-Person Auth Department**
   - Hidden FTE costs
   - Opportunity cost of clinical staff doing admin work
   
2. **Physician Burnout Factor**
   - Time spent on peer-to-peers
   - EHR documentation burden
   - "Moral injury" of denied care

3. **The Abandonment Crisis**
   - 30% of patients give up
   - Lifetime value loss
   - Reputation damage

4. **Technology Overwhelm**
   - Too many vendors, unclear ROI
   - Integration challenges
   - Change management hurdles

## Content Themes - Provider Side

### "Control Your Controllables"
- Stop blaming payers for everything
- Fix your own house first
- Quick wins that don't require payer cooperation

### The Proactive Approach
- Get ahead of denials
- Check requirements at scheduling
- Build denial prevention into workflows

### Smart Specialization
- Dedicated auth teams vs distributed model
- Payer-specific expertise
- Creating "auth athletes"

### The "Golden Hour" Concept
- First 24 hours critical for approval
- After 48 hours, abandonment rate skyrockets
- Speed matters more than perfection

   - Providers achieving <24hr TAT
   - Denial rate reduction cases
   - ROI from process improvement

3. **Technology Adoption**
   - What actually works?
   - Integration success stories
   - Vendor comparison data

## Differentiation from Payer Issue

### Provider Issue Focus

### Payer Issue Focus (Part 2)

- Negotiation strategies
- Long-term relationship building

## Key Messages for Providers

1. "You have more control than you think"
2. "Small changes = big impact"
3. "Process before technology"
4. "Data drives payer negotiations"
5. "Your staff are drowning - throw them a rope"

## Call to Action
- Measure your baseline THIS WEEK
- Pick ONE payer to optimize for
- Read Part 2 to understand their perspective
- Join both sides at the table

## Series Connection Points
- End with: "But what does this look like from the payer side?"
- Tease Part 2 insights
- Encourage payers to read for self-reflection
- Promise the "full picture" across both issues
