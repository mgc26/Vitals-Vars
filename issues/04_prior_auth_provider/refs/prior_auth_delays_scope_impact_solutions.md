# Prior Authorization Delays in Healthcare: Scope, Impact, and Solutions

## Executive Summary

Prior authorization (PA) is a utilization management process where healthcare providers must obtain approval from insurers before proceeding with certain treatments, tests, or medications. In theory, PAs are meant to control costs and ensure appropriate care, but in practice they often introduce significant delays and administrative burdens. This report provides a deep dive into the current state of PA delays, their financial and clinical impact, root causes of the problem, and strategies – including technology and policy changes – that can help address this pressing issue. The focus is U.S. healthcare in 2025, where new reforms and innovations are on the horizon.

## Current State of Prior Authorization Delays

### Volume and Burden
Physicians and their staff are inundated with prior authorization requests. An AMA survey in late 2024 found that practices handle about 39 PA requests per physician per week, consuming an average of 13 hours of physician/staff time weekly. Another survey showed similar figures – roughly 45 requests taking 14 hours per week on average. This equates to nearly two full business days spent on paperwork instead of patient care. It's no surprise that 89–90% of physicians rate the PA workload as "high or extremely high", and many have had to hire extra employees to keep up. About 35–40% of doctors have staff who work exclusively on prior authorizations, illustrating how managing PAs has become a specialized role in itself.

### Care Delays
The vast majority of providers report that PAs routinely delay necessary care for patients. In an AMA survey, 93% of physicians said their patients experienced care delays due to prior auth requirements. These delays are often substantial. One patient survey by the Arthritis Foundation found the average wait time for a PA decision was about 3 days, and 31% of patients waited more than a week for an answer. Such waits can postpone critical tests or treatments. For urgent situations, even a few days' delay can be dangerous – and indeed 23% of physicians reported PA delays have led to a patient's hospitalization, with 8% reporting cases of permanent disability or death in their patients.

### Denial Rates
Not all authorization requests are approved, and denial rates contribute to delays (through appeals or searching for alternatives) or outright care abandonment. Precise denial rates vary by payer and setting. In Medicare Advantage (MA) plans, about 6.4% of prior authorization requests were denied in 2023 (either fully or partially). This was actually an improvement from 7.4% in 2022, but higher than denial rates a few years prior. Importantly, over 80% of denied requests that were appealed ended up being overturned in MA – meaning the majority of those initial denials were ultimately deemed inappropriate or unnecessary.

### Abandoned Procedures and Patient Impact
One of the most alarming aspects of PA delays is the risk that patients simply give up on receiving care. In a 2024 AMA survey, 82% of physicians said that patients had abandoned treatment due to PA issues – for example, a patient never getting a recommended test or procedure because the approval took too long or was too difficult. Another survey similarly reported 78–80% of physicians have seen patients sometimes or often abandon a needed intervention because of the hassles or delays associated with prior auth. These are staggering numbers that underscore a real breakdown in access: when the administrative process becomes so cumbersome, patients may forego care altogether.

## Financial Impact of Authorization Delays

### Administrative Costs
The industry-wide expense of performing prior authorizations is enormous. According to the Council for Affordable Quality Healthcare (CAQH), the U.S. healthcare system spends over $13 billion annually on prior authorization processes. This figure includes the labor, overhead, and technology costs for providers and payers to handle PA requests. For providers in particular, each individual authorization request is a labor-intensive task. Studies show that a single manual prior auth request takes around 20–30 minutes of staff time and costs providers roughly $10–$11 on average in labor.

### Staffing and Workflow Costs
Many healthcare organizations have had to invest in dedicated staff and infrastructure to manage authorizations, effectively increasing their operating costs. For example, 40% of physicians report employing staff who work only on PAs. These are salaries and benefits paid for administrative work that does not directly add value to patient care. In some multi-specialty clinics and hospitals, entire departments (authorization coordinators, referral specialists) exist just to handle the volume of PAs.

### Lost Revenue from Denials and Delays
Authorization issues can directly hit the bottom line when services are delayed or denied. If a procedure is canceled or postponed because auth wasn't obtained in time, that's lost revenue for the facility. Even worse, if care is provided without realizing an auth was needed (a common scenario in emergencies or when requirements are unclear), the claim may be denied and the provider might not get paid at all. The Advisory Board has estimated that as much as 12% of hospital revenue is tied up in denied claims – and prior authorization is a leading cause of those denials.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Insurer Requirements and Clinical Criteria
One fundamental cause is that insurers often require specific clinical criteria to be met before approving a service, and these criteria can be quite rigid or differ from standard practice. If a request doesn't tick every box of the insurer's policy, it may be denied as "not medically necessary." Many physicians feel these criteria are often not evidence-based – 31% said PA rules were "rarely or never" based on clinical guidelines from their specialty society.

### Incomplete or Incorrect Documentation
A very common proximate cause of PA denials is missing information or paperwork errors in the request. If a provider submits a prior auth request without including a key piece of documentation that the insurer needs to see (say, lack of a lab result, or missing clinical notes), the request can be denied or kicked back. Insufficient documentation is consistently cited as a top reason for PA denials.

### Timing and Process Breakdowns
Prior authorization is a multi-step process that can break down at several points. First, the need for an authorization must be recognized. Delays often start when this doesn't happen promptly – e.g., if an office realizes only the day before a procedure that an auth is required, they're already behind the clock. Next, once submitted, insurers may take days or even weeks to respond, which is another major delay point.

### Payer Variability and Complexity
Each insurance payer has its own set of rules, and in many cases uses third-party vendors to manage prior authorizations (e.g., radiology benefits managers or pharmacy benefit managers). This creates a fragmented landscape of requirements that providers must navigate. One insurer might require prior auth for all specialist referrals, another only for certain procedures; one might use an online portal form, another requires a phone call.

## Intervention Effectiveness

### Real-Time Eligibility & Authorization Checks
One promising approach is to check insurance requirements as early as possible – ideally at the time of scheduling or even ordering a service. Many organizations now run an eligibility and authorization check when a procedure is being scheduled. This involves querying the insurer's system (through a portal or clearinghouse) to see if an auth is needed, and in some cases, initiating that request immediately.

### Clinical Decision Support (CDS) for PA Criteria
Another intervention is embedding authorization requirements into the clinical workflow so that providers "get it right" when ordering. This can take the form of clinical decision support pop-ups or order templates in the EHR that guide physicians on what an insurer will need. For instance, if a doctor orders an expensive injectable drug for rheumatoid arthritis, the system might prompt: "This drug often requires prior auth. Has the patient tried methotrexate (first-line therapy)? If yes, document the outcome."

### Automation and AI Solutions
Given the labor-intensive nature of prior auth, automation is a hot area of innovation. Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is being used by some providers to take over repetitive tasks like data entry on payer websites. An RPA "bot" can, for example, log into an insurer's portal at midnight, enter patient and procedure info, upload scanned documents, and submit an auth request – all actions a human would normally do during the day.

## Technology Landscape and Future Outlook

### EHR-Integrated Prior Auth Workflows
One major trend is the integration of PA capabilities directly into Electronic Health Record systems. Vendors like Epic, Cerner (now Oracle Health), and others have been developing modules that allow clinicians and staff to initiate and track prior authorizations within the EHR interface, rather than logging into external payer portals or making phone calls.

### Third-Party Authorization Platforms
Besides EHR vendors, a number of third-party companies provide platforms or services to help with prior auth. These range from software tools to full outsourcing services. On the software side, clearinghouses like Availity and Change Healthcare (Optum) have portals that providers can use to submit PAs to multiple payers in one place.

### Automation, AI, and RPA Vendors
Olive is a company that gained a lot of attention (and funding) for promising to automate healthcare administrative tasks, including prior auth, using a blend of AI and RPA. They have deployed bots in many hospitals to handle things like insurance verification and prior auth submissions. Another company, Notable, uses AI to automate repetitive tasks by understanding workflows through computer vision and then executing them – applicable to PA forms and portals.

## Best Practices and Quick Wins for Providers

### Check Requirements Early (No Surprises)
Make it standard procedure to verify whether a service needs prior authorization at the point of scheduling or referral. For elective procedures, this means when the patient is being scheduled for, say, an MRI or a surgery in a few weeks, the scheduler or an auth specialist checks the insurance requirements that day.

### Use Templates and Checklists for Common Requests
Identify the top 10–20 services for which your practice most frequently needs prior auth (e.g., MRI scans, CT scans, certain surgeries, high-cost drugs). Develop standardized templates or checklist forms for each of these that include all information payers typically want to see.

### Centralize and Coordinate the PA Process
If prior authorizations are handled ad hoc by each physician or front-desk person, consider centralizing the function or at least coordinating it more formally. Dedicated prior authorization teams or coordinators can be more efficient and effective because they develop expertise and accountability.

### Empower and Educate Clinicians
Oftentimes, delays come from providers not realizing what's needed until a request is denied. By educating clinicians on common PA requirements for their specialty, you can turn them into allies in the process. For example, let your cardiologists know that for nuclear stress tests, insurer A always needs to see a recent stress ECG result – so they should order that first or include why it's not applicable.

## Conclusion

Prior authorization delays represent a classic case of a well-intended policy tool gone awry at scale – burdening providers, frustrating patients, and even harming outcomes. The evidence is overwhelming that the current state is unsustainable: virtually all physicians report negative impacts on care, and billions are wasted on administrative churn. The financial and human toll has caught the attention of policymakers, leading to a rare area of bipartisan agreement that PA reform is needed.

With new regulations set to enforce faster, more transparent processes and with technology innovations accelerating, we are on the cusp of meaningful change. For healthcare organizations, the challenge is to navigate the present while preparing for the future. In the short term, optimizing internal processes and leveraging available tools can alleviate the burden – ensuring fewer patients fall through the cracks due to authorization issues. In the longer term, providers should engage with and adopt emerging electronic prior auth solutions, as these promise to cut down turnaround times from days to hours and shift much of the work from humans to machines.

The goal is a system where prior authorization is a back-end check, largely automated, that rarely impedes patient care. Achieving that will restore prior auth to a reasonable utilization management tactic rather than a pervasive barrier.
