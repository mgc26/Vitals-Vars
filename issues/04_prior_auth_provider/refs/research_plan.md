# Research Plan for Prior Authorization Delays Issue

## Priority Research Questions

### 1. Current State Evidence
- What are national benchmarks for prior auth turnaround times?
- What percentage of authorizations result in denials?
- How many procedures are abandoned due to auth delays?
- What is the average staff time spent per authorization?
- How do auth requirements vary by payer and procedure type?

### 2. Financial Impact
- Revenue lost from abandoned procedures
- Staff costs for authorization management
- Opportunity costs of delayed care
- Impact on patient satisfaction and retention
- Cost of denial appeals and peer-to-peers

### 3. Root Cause Analysis
- Why do authorizations get denied? (clinical criteria, documentation, timing)
- Where are the biggest delays in the auth process?
- Which payers have the most complex requirements?
- What role does technology play currently?
- How do high-performing organizations manage auth?

### 4. Intervention Effectiveness
- Real-time eligibility and auth checking
- Clinical decision support for auth requirements
- Automation and AI solutions
- Process standardization
- Staff training and specialization
- Payer relationship management

### 5. Technology Landscape
- EHR-integrated auth solutions
- Third-party auth platforms
- AI/ML for denial prediction
- Robotic process automation (RPA)
- Payer portals and APIs
