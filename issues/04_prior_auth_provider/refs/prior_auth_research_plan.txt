Navigating the Prior Authorization Crisis: A Strategic Report
on Mitigating Delays, Reducing Financial Toxicity, and
Harnessing a New Era of Automation

Executive Summary

The U.S. healthcare system is contending with a prior authorization (PA) process that
has evolved from a targeted cost-control mechanism into a pervasive source of
administrative waste, financial strain, and direct patient harm. This report provides a
comprehensive analysis of the PA crisis, synthesizing data from leading industry
bodies, regulatory filings, and financial analyses to equip healthcare leadership with
the strategic intelligence necessary to navigate this complex challenge.
The operational burden on provider organizations is staggering and continues to
grow. A typical physician practice now completes an average of 39 to 45 prior
authorizations per physician each week, consuming 12 to 13 hours of physician and
staff time—the equivalent of nearly two full business days diverted from patient care.1
This has forced an estimated 92% of medical groups to hire or redistribute staff
specifically to manage this workload, transforming PA management into a significant,
non-reimbursable administrative overhead.4
This administrative friction has dire consequences for patients. An overwhelming 94%
of physicians report that PA processes delay access to necessary medical care.6
These delays are a primary driver of treatment abandonment, with 78% of physicians
reporting that patients forgo their recommended course of care due to the
cumbersome process.8 Most alarmingly, these delays are not benign; 24% of
physicians report that a PA delay has led to a serious adverse event for a patient,
including hospitalization, permanent disability, or death.2
Financially, the system is paradoxical. While intended to control costs, PA processes
are a significant driver of financial toxicity for providers and inflationary pressure on
the system. The direct cost of manual PA processing is estimated to be as high as

$11,000 annually per clinician.11 These costs are compounded by lost revenue from
denials, which are frequently issued for administrative reasons rather than a lack of
medical necessity. In Medicare Advantage, 81.7% of appealed PA denials are
overturned, proving the initial decisions were flawed.2 Yet, due to the immense burden
of the appeals process, only 11.7% of denials are ever challenged, allowing payers to
retain revenue that providers are rightfully owed.13 Furthermore, 88% of physicians
report that PA leads to
higher overall resource utilization through avoidable emergency department visits and
hospitalizations, undermining its core purpose.1
However, the landscape is on the cusp of a fundamental transformation. The
confluence of landmark federal regulation and rapid technological advancement
presents a clear path forward. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)
Interoperability and Prior Authorization Final Rule will, by 2027, mandate standardized,
electronic APIs for PA transactions, creating a "digital floor" for the industry and
promising to save physician practices an estimated $15 billion over the next decade.14
Concurrently, the maturation of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and
Robotic Process Automation (RPA) offers tools to predict and prevent denials,
automate workflows, and transform PA management from a reactive, manual burden
into a proactive, intelligent, and integrated function.
This report concludes with a strategic framework for provider organizations. The path
to optimization involves a multi-pronged approach: implementing foundational
process improvements and dedicated staffing models; adopting a sophisticated
technology stack that leverages EHR-integrated solutions, third-party platforms, and
AI/RPA; and engaging in forward-looking advocacy for programs like "gold-carding."
The ultimate objective is to transition from the current dysfunctional state to a future
where prior authorization is a seamless, real-time, and largely invisible component of
the care delivery workflow, restoring the focus to patient outcomes and financial
stability.

I. The Pervasive Challenge of Prior Authorization: Quantifying the
National Burden

Prior authorization, a utilization management process originally designed by health

plans to control costs for a narrow set of services, has expanded into a ubiquitous and
burdensome feature of the American healthcare landscape.17 Data from recent
national surveys of physicians and medical groups paint a stark picture of a system
generating an unsustainable administrative load, causing demonstrable harm to
patients, and fueling a crisis of physician burnout. The evidence demonstrates that PA
is no longer a simple administrative checkpoint but a significant operational and
clinical impediment.

A. The Escalating Administrative Load on Healthcare Providers

The volume and complexity of prior authorization requirements have surged, placing
an immense strain on provider resources. According to the American Medical
Association (AMA), 81% of physicians report that the number of required PAs has
increased over the past five years.18 This is not a marginal increase; medical practices
now complete an average of 45 prior authorizations per physician, per week, a figure
corroborated by multiple surveys that place the average between 39 and 45.1
This workload translates directly into a massive diversion of time and human capital
away from clinical duties. On average, physician practices spend 12 to 13 hours per
physician each week completing these requests.1 This equates to nearly two full
eight-hour business days per week, per physician, dedicated solely to administrative
tasks that do not directly contribute to patient care. The burden is so profound that a
significant portion of the provider workforce is now dedicated to this function.
Surveys from the Medical Group Management Association (MGMA) reveal that 92% of
medical practices have had to hire new staff or redistribute existing staff to work on
prior authorizations due to the increase in requests.4 Further data shows that 35% to
40% of physicians now employ staff members who work exclusively on PA-related
tasks.2 One practice manager noted that over 15 years, their PA-related staff grew
from one full-time equivalent (FTE) to twelve, while the practice itself only grew by
20%.22 This represents a substantial and growing non-reimbursable administrative
cost that directly impacts a practice's financial viability.
The perception of this burden among frontline clinicians is nearly universal. Across
multiple annual surveys, an overwhelming majority of physicians and practice
leaders—between 88% and 89.35%—describe prior authorization requirements as
"high," "extremely high," or "very or extremely" burdensome.3 This sentiment has been
consistently high for years, with MGMA polls showing over 80% of healthcare leaders

reporting increased PA requirements annually since 2016.23

B. The Human Cost: Documented Impacts on Patient Care, Safety, and Outcomes

The immense administrative friction created by the PA process is the direct cause of
quantifiable harm to patients. The most immediate and widely reported consequence
is the delay of medically necessary care. An overwhelming 93% to 94% of physicians
report that the PA process "sometimes, often, or always" results in delays to patient
access to care.1 These are not insignificant pauses; 64% of physicians report waiting
at least one business day for a PA decision, while nearly one-third (29-30%) state they
wait three or more business days.19 For urgent requests, state laws like Michigan's
mandate a 72-hour turnaround, but this timeframe resets if the payer requests
additional information.29
Faced with these delays and the associated uncertainty, a staggering number of
patients simply give up on their prescribed treatment. Between 78% and 82% of
physicians report that issues related to the PA process lead patients to abandon their
recommended course of treatment altogether.6 This phenomenon of "treatment
abandonment" represents a catastrophic failure of the care delivery system, where a
bureaucratic process actively prevents a willing patient and a willing provider from
proceeding with necessary care.
The consequences of these delays and abandonments are not merely inconvenient;
they are clinically dangerous. A consistent and alarming finding across multiple AMA
surveys is that a significant portion of physicians—between 24% and 33%—report
that the PA process has led to a serious adverse event for a patient in their care.2
These events are categorized with grim specificity:
●​ Patient Hospitalization: 18% to 23% of physicians report that a PA delay directly

led to a patient's hospitalization.2
●​ Life-Threatening Events: 13% to 19% of physicians report PA leading to a
life-threatening event or requiring intervention to prevent permanent impairment
or damage.2
●​ Death or Permanent Disability: In the most tragic outcomes, 7% to 9% of
physicians report that PA has led to a patient's disability, permanent bodily
damage, congenital anomaly, birth defect, or death.2 A 2024 survey of radiation
oncologists found that 7% of respondents said PA had led to a patient death, and

30% said it had caused an emergency room visit, hospitalization, or permanent
disability.33
Beyond these acute events, the vast majority of physicians (89% to 94%) believe the
PA process has a "somewhat or significantly" negative impact on overall patient
clinical outcomes.1 This includes the destabilization of patients whose conditions were
previously managed effectively on a specific treatment plan (reported by 61% of
physicians) and a near-universal agreement (89%) that PA interferes with the
continuity of care.17
The data reveals a clear and destructive causal chain: the immense administrative
burden imposed on provider organizations is not merely a "hassle." This resource
drain directly creates processing backlogs and communication failures, which
manifest as care delays. These delays, in turn, cause a significant percentage of
patients to abandon necessary treatment. Finally, for a substantial subset of these
patients, particularly those with time-sensitive conditions like cancer, the delay or
abandonment of care leads directly to preventable, serious, and sometimes fatal
adverse health outcomes. Addressing the administrative friction is, therefore, a direct
patient safety imperative.
Furthermore, the scale and consistency of these statistics across multiple years
suggest a profound systemic failure. When over 90% of physicians consistently report
care delays and over 75% report treatment abandonment, these outcomes are no
longer exceptional failures. They have become a normalized, expected feature of the
healthcare delivery system. This normalization is a dangerous form of institutional
inertia, creating a high tolerance for process-induced patient harm and shifting the
focus from preventing these failures to simply managing their inevitable occurrence.

C. A System in Distress: Physician Burnout and Resource Diversion

The relentless pressure of the prior authorization process is a significant contributor

to the national crisis of physician burnout. A near-unanimous 95% of physicians
report that PA requirements "somewhat or significantly" increase feelings of burnout.6
This is driven not only by the sheer volume of administrative work but also by the
profound professional dissatisfaction and "moral injury" that arises from having their
clinical judgment repeatedly questioned, often by reviewers with less expertise.6
This erosion of professional autonomy is exacerbated by a pervasive lack of
transparency in the PA system. A majority of physicians (61-65%) report that it is
difficult to even determine whether a specific medical service or prescription requires
a prior authorization in the first place.17 When they turn to their primary clinical tools
for answers, the information is often unreliable; nearly one-third of physicians
(30-33%) report that the PA requirement information provided within their Electronic
Health Record (EHR) or e-prescribing systems is "rarely or never" accurate.6 This
opacity creates a constant state of uncertainty, forcing staff into time-consuming
manual verification processes (phone calls, portal searches) and fueling a
deep-seated frustration and mistrust between providers and payers. This environment
of inefficiency and antagonism directly undermines the collaborative relationships
necessary for a high-functioning healthcare system.

II. The Financial Toll of Inefficiency: A Multi-Layered Cost Analysis

While payers champion prior authorization as a critical tool for cost containment, a
detailed financial analysis reveals a more complex and troubling reality. The process
imposes substantial direct costs on provider organizations, creates significant
revenue cycle disruption, and generates system-wide economic waste that may
ultimately counteract its intended savings. For providers, PA is not a cost-neutral
administrative process; it is a direct drain on financial resources and a primary driver
of revenue leakage.

A. Direct Costs to Provider Organizations: Staffing, Rework, and Overhead

The financial burden of managing prior authorizations begins with direct, measurable
costs. Analyses show that the annual administrative cost of PA ranges from $2,161 to

$3,430 per full-time primary care physician.32 Other studies, encompassing a broader
range of clinicians, estimate this cost to be even higher, at approximately $11,046 per
clinician per year, a figure that includes nurse practitioners and physician assistants
who also generate PA requests.11 For a practice with 10 clinicians, this translates to
over $110,000 in annual overhead dedicated solely to PA management.11
The Council for Affordable Quality Healthcare (CAQH), which provides the industry's
most granular transaction-level cost data, illuminates the severe cost-shifting inherent
in the current system. According to the 2023 CAQH Index, a single manual prior
authorization transaction (conducted via phone or fax) costs a provider organization
an average of $10.97. In stark contrast, the cost to the payer for processing that same
manual transaction is only $3.52. The disparity is even more pronounced for fully
electronic transactions, which cost the provider $5.79 but cost the payer a mere five
cents.34
This economic structure reveals a profound asymmetry. A payer can impose a
high-friction, manual process on a provider at a low cost to itself, knowing that the
provider must absorb a cost that is more than three times higher to comply. This is not
a partnership; it is a financial war of attrition where payers possess a significant
structural advantage. This imbalance creates a powerful financial incentive for payers
to resist moving away from manual processes, as the friction they create is largely an
externalized cost borne by the provider network. For providers, this means that simply
trying to "work harder" or become more efficient at manual processes is a
fundamentally losing strategy. The only viable path to mitigating this cost is to force a
systemic shift to automated, low-cost electronic channels where this asymmetry is
reduced.
The cost of rework further compounds the financial strain. Denied claims are not just
lost revenue; they are an additional expense. The Healthcare Financial Management
Association (HFMA) estimates that the average cost to rework a single denied claim
falls between $25 and $118, depending on its complexity.35 A case study examining
prior authorizations for upper endoscopy procedures provides a vivid example: a
practice spent $9,740 in employee expenses to achieve a 97.3% first-pass approval
rate. However, appealing the remaining 54 denials cost an additional $9,450 in lost
clinician time, nearly doubling the total expense to secure payment for that small
fraction of cases.11

B. Revenue Cycle Disruption: The Impact of Denials, Write-Offs, and Delayed Cash

Flow

Beyond direct overhead, prior authorization is one of the most disruptive forces in the
healthcare revenue cycle. Issues related to PA are a leading cause of claim denials,
which directly impact cash flow and profitability. According to the Advisory Board, as
much as 12% of a hospital's net revenue can be at risk due to denied claims, with
PA-related issues being a primary culprit.35 One report found that the dollar value of
inpatient denials driven by PA issues surged by 67% in just over a year and a half,
growing from 1.5% to 2.5% of gross revenue.36
The industry-average claim denial rate hovers between 5% and 10%, a range that
healthy organizations strive to stay below.37 Lack of prior authorization is a major
contributor to this rate. Some analyses indicate that up to 25% of all denied claims are
due to utilization management issues like missing PA codes.38 Another source
suggests that in a staggering 81% of cases where a claim is denied, the prior
authorization was either not obtained or was handled improperly.28 This leads to
significant and often avoidable revenue loss. The healthcare industry as a whole is
estimated to lose up to $5 billion annually from PA-related denials alone.39 For an
average-sized health system, this can translate into 110,000 unpaid claims in a single
year due to denials from PA and other factors.36

C. System-Wide Economic Waste: The Paradox of Cost Control

The most profound financial indictment of the prior authorization system is the
evidence that it often fails at its primary objective: controlling overall healthcare costs.
Instead of reducing spending, it frequently shifts costs and drives up total resource
utilization. A remarkable 86% to 88% of physicians report that PA requirements lead to
higher overall utilization of healthcare resources, resulting in unnecessary waste.1
This paradoxical effect is not abstract; it is driven by specific, quantifiable diversions
of care that occur as a direct result of PA-induced delays and denials:
●​ Ineffective Initial Treatments: 64% to 69% of physicians report that

step-therapy requirements force patients to try and fail on less effective or poorly
tolerated treatments before the originally prescribed therapy is approved.3 This
generates costs for ineffective care.

●​ Additional Office Visits: 62% to 68% of physicians report that managing PA

issues leads to additional, otherwise unnecessary office visits.3
●​ Escalation to Urgent/Emergency Care: 42% to 46% of physicians report that PA
delays have forced patients to seek care in more expensive settings, such as an
urgent care center or emergency department.3
●​ Avoidable Hospitalizations: 29% of physicians report that PA delays have
directly led to patient hospitalizations that could have been avoided with timely
outpatient treatment.3
This evidence points to PA acting as an inflationary force within the healthcare
system. It increases direct provider overhead, which must be factored into cost
structures and payer contract negotiations. More critically, by delaying or preventing
appropriate, lower-cost outpatient care, it directly causes a shift to higher-acuity,
higher-cost settings. The "savings" generated by denying a $500 imaging study are
often dwarfed by the eventual cost of a $20,000 emergency admission that results
from the delayed diagnosis. This transforms prior authorization from a
cost-containment tool into a mechanism for cost-shifting and, ultimately,
cost-inflation. The total administrative spending on PA in the U.S. is estimated to be
$35 billion, a colossal figure that does not even include these downstream costs of
escalated care.12

D. Quantifying the Automation Opportunity: An Analysis of CAQH Benchmarks

While the financial picture is bleak, the data also clearly illuminates the path to
recovery: automation. The CAQH Index is the definitive source for quantifying the
financial opportunity available through administrative simplification. The 2023 report
found that the U.S. healthcare industry has the potential to save an additional $18.3
billion annually by converting all remaining manual and partially electronic
administrative transactions to fully electronic, standardized formats.43
The power of automation is not theoretical; it is proven. The industry is already
avoiding an estimated $193 billion to $222 billion in annual administrative costs thanks
to the electronic transactions currently in place.43 This figure represents a 15%
increase in avoided costs compared to the previous year, demonstrating the
accelerating value of automation.44
For prior authorization specifically, the savings are substantial. When a specialty

practice switches from a completely manual PA process to a fully electronic one, it
can save an average of $8.51 per transaction.45 Extrapolated across the entire medical
industry, if all PA transactions were conducted electronically, the system would realize
an estimated
$494 million in annual savings.34 While this is a significant figure, it is dwarfed by the
potential savings in higher-volume transactions, such as the $9.3 billion opportunity in
eligibility and benefit verification and the $3.2 billion opportunity in claim status
inquiries.46 This suggests that a comprehensive automation strategy targeting the
entire administrative workflow can yield transformative financial results.

III. Deconstructing the Delays: A Root Cause Analysis of PA
Failures

To effectively solve the prior authorization crisis, it is essential to move beyond
documenting its symptoms and conduct a rigorous root cause analysis of its failures.
The evidence overwhelmingly indicates that the system is not failing because
clinicians are consistently ordering inappropriate care. Rather, it is failing due to a
combination of flawed administrative processes, a lack of standardization, opaque
and inconsistent payer policies, and perverse incentives that reward friction over
efficiency.

A. The Anatomy of a Denial: Administrative, Documentation, and Clinical Criteria
Failures

A deep dive into denial reasons reveals that the vast majority of PA rejections are
rooted in administrative and procedural errors, not fundamental disagreements over
medical necessity. The most commonly cited reasons for denial include:
●​ Incomplete or Incorrect Information: This is a primary driver of denials. Simple

clerical errors such as missing patient demographic details, incorrect or
transposed insurance ID numbers, mismatched provider NPIs, or outdated
information are frequent and avoidable culprits.28
●​ Failure to Provide Medical Necessity Documentation: While payers often list

"lack of medical necessity" as a top denial reason, this is frequently a misnomer.39
The issue is typically not that the service is clinically inappropriate, but that the
provider failed to submit the specific, and often extensive, documentation
required by the payer to​
prove necessity. This can include a comprehensive packet of medical records,
recent clinical notes, diagnostic test results, or evidence of failed conservative
treatments (step therapy).39
●​ Incorrect Coding: Mismatched Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) or
International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes are a
common cause for automatic rejection.39
●​ Procedural Errors: A significant number of denials occur simply because a
provider's office failed to obtain a required authorization before a non-emergency
service was rendered.47
Data from Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace plans powerfully reinforces this
point. An analysis of these plans found that only 6% of in-network claim denials were
based on a lack of medical necessity. The most common reasons were the vague
category of "Other" (34%), followed by administrative reasons (18%), the service
being excluded from the plan's benefits (16%), and a lack of prior authorization or
referral (9%).54 This confirms that the PA process is breaking down on administrative
and procedural grounds long before clinical judgment comes into play.
The "documentation gap" is perhaps the most critical point of failure. However, this is
not merely a matter of provider carelessness. It is a direct and inevitable symptom of a
deeper, systemic problem: the "standardization gap." A single provider organization
may work with dozens of different payers, each with its own unique and constantly
changing set of rules, submission portals, and required forms.18 It is operationally
infeasible for any practice, especially one relying on manual processes, to perfectly
track and execute dozens of disparate documentation protocols without error. The
high rate of documentation-related denials is not an indictment of provider
competence, but rather an expected outcome of a chaotic, non-standardized system.
The root cause is not provider error in a vacuum; it is provider error induced by
systemic complexity.

B. The Payer Black Box: Inconsistent Policies and Manual Bottlenecks

The lack of standardization is the central design flaw of the entire PA ecosystem. Each

payer operates within its own silo, establishing proprietary rules, clinical guidelines,
and submission mechanisms.18 These requirements often change with little notice,
forcing provider staff to rely on ad-hoc "cheat sheets" that quickly become
outdated.56 This fragmentation makes automation difficult and perpetuates a reliance
on outdated, inefficient technology.
Despite advances in healthcare IT, the PA process remains stubbornly manual.
Physicians consistently report that the telephone is the most common method for
completing PA requests, a process notorious for long hold times and inefficiency.17
Faxes and a constellation of unique, non-standardized payer web portals are also
prevalent methods of submission.4 As a result, only 28% to 31% of medical PA
transactions are conducted in a fully electronic, standardized format (the
HIPAA-mandated X12-278 transaction).21 This reliance on antiquated, manual
workflows is a primary bottleneck that introduces errors and delays.59
When a denial does occur and a clinical discussion is required, the peer-to-peer (P2P)
review process often fails to live up to its name. Intended to be a discussion between
clinical equals, it is frequently a source of intense frustration for treating physicians.
According to AMA surveys, only 15% of physicians report that the health plan's "peer"
often or always has the appropriate qualifications and specialty expertise to evaluate
their clinical decision.6 This transforms what should be a productive clinical
conversation into yet another administrative hurdle, where a specialist must justify
their decision to a non-specialist reviewer.62

C. The Appeals Paradox: Why High Overturn Rates Signal a Flawed Front-End
Process

Perhaps the most damning evidence of a broken system lies in the "appeals paradox":
the chasm between an extremely high rate of successful appeals and an extremely
low rate of attempted appeals.
Across the Medicare Advantage landscape, an astounding 81.7% of prior
authorization denials that are appealed are subsequently partially or fully overturned
by the payer.2 This figure has remained consistently high for years. This statistic is an
unambiguous admission that the vast majority of initial denials are incorrect. They are
not based on firm, defensible clinical reasoning but on administrative technicalities,

missing paperwork that is later supplied, or flawed initial reviews.
Despite this high probability of success, only a tiny fraction of denials—just 11.7% in
Medicare Advantage—are ever appealed.2 This gap is the result of "administrative
surrender." The burden of navigating the appeals process—gathering additional
documentation, writing letters, and engaging in time-consuming P2P calls—is so
immense that providers make a rational economic decision to simply give up.1 They
are forced to write off revenue they are legitimately owed because the cost and effort
of fighting for it are prohibitively high.
This dynamic suggests that for some payers, a high initial denial rate may be a
deliberate financial strategy, not an operational flaw. By issuing a large volume of
easily reversible denials, a payer can leverage the low appeal rate to its advantage. For
every 100 denials issued, if only 12 are appealed, the payer successfully avoids
payment on the other 88. Even if 82% of the appealed cases (about 10) are
overturned, the payer still achieves a net "win" on 88% of its initial denials. The denial
itself, regardless of its clinical validity, becomes the cost-saving tool because of the
high administrative barrier to challenging it. This represents a strategic weaponization
of administrative burden.

D. Payer-Specific Performance: A Comparative Analysis of Denial and Appeal
Metrics

The burden of prior authorization is not distributed evenly. Data analysis reveals
significant variation in the utilization management strategies and denial rates of major
national payers. A KFF analysis of 2023 Medicare Advantage data, reported by outlets
like Becker's Hospital Review, provides actionable, comparative intelligence for
providers.65
●​ Denial Rates: The average denial rate for PA requests in MA was 6.4% in 2023.

However, this average masks a wide range, from a low of 3.5% for Humana to a
high of 13.6% for Centene. CVS Health (Aetna) was also high at 11%.13
●​ Intensity of Utilization Management: The number of PA requests per enrollee
also varied dramatically, indicating different philosophies on managing care.
Humana and Anthem/Elevance Health were the most aggressive, with 3.1 requests
per member, while Kaiser Permanente was the least, at just 0.5.65
●​ Appeal and Overturn Rates: The data for payers with the highest denial rates is

particularly telling. Centene, with its 13.6% denial rate, also had one of the highest
overturn rates on appeal at a staggering 93.6%. CVS Health, with an 11% denial
rate, had an 89.7% overturn rate.65 This combination of high initial denials and
extremely high overturn rates strongly supports the hypothesis that denials are
being used as an administrative filter rather than a precise clinical tool.

This scorecard provides critical intelligence for provider organizations. It allows
leadership to move from anecdotal complaints to data-driven conversations during
payer negotiations. It can inform RCM resource allocation, justifying the assignment of
more experienced staff to manage payers with higher denial rates. It also provides
concrete evidence for advocacy efforts aimed at curbing the most egregious payer
behaviors.

IV. The Horizon of Change: The Regulatory and Technological
Revolution in Prior Authorization

While the current state of prior authorization is fraught with inefficiency and friction,
the landscape is on the verge of a seismic shift. Two powerful forces—landmark
federal regulation and the rapid maturation of intelligent automation
technologies—are converging to dismantle the manual, opaque processes of the past
and usher in a new era of electronic, transparent, and streamlined PA management.
For provider organizations, understanding and preparing for these changes is not just
a matter of compliance; it is a strategic imperative for survival and success.

A. Landmark Legislation: The CMS Interoperability and Prior Authorization Final
Rule (CMS-0057-F)

Released by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) on January 17,
2024, the Interoperability and Prior Authorization Final Rule (CMS-0057-F) represents
the most significant federal intervention to reform PA to date.67 The rule targets the

root causes of delays and administrative burden by mandating greater transparency,
faster decision-making, and, most importantly, the adoption of standardized
electronic data exchange. The rule applies to a broad swath of the market, including
Medicare Advantage (MA) plans, state Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance
Program (CHIP) plans (both fee-for-service and managed care), and Qualified Health
Plan (QHP) issuers on the Federally-Facilitated Marketplaces.16
The rule's key provisions are set to be implemented on a staggered timeline:
●​ Stricter Turnaround Times (Compliance by January 1, 2026): Impacted payers

will be required to make decisions on standard (non-urgent) PA requests within 7
calendar days, a significant reduction from the current 14-day allowance for MA
plans. For expedited (urgent) requests, a decision must be rendered within 72
hours.15 This establishes a federal floor for timeliness, forcing payers to
re-engineer their internal review processes for greater speed.
●​ Transparency Mandates (Compliance by January 1, 2026): Payers will be
required to provide a specific, valid reason for any PA denial, moving beyond
cryptic codes to offer clear, actionable feedback to providers.15 They must also
begin publicly reporting certain aggregate PA metrics, shining a light on their
performance and enabling comparisons.
●​ Standardized, FHIR-Based APIs (Compliance by January 1, 2027): This is the
technological centerpiece of the rule. Payers must develop, implement, and
maintain a suite of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) built on the Fast
Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard. These APIs are designed
to automate the electronic exchange of PA data, breaking down the silos of
proprietary portals and fax machines.16
The mandated APIs will create a new, interconnected ecosystem for PA:
●​ Prior Authorization API (PARDD): The Prior Authorization Requirements,

Documentation, and Decision API will be the workhorse of the new system. It will
allow a provider's EHR or practice management system to electronically and
automatically query a payer to determine if a PA is required, identify the specific
documentation needed, submit the PA request, and receive a decision in
real-time.16
●​ Payer-to-Payer API: To improve care continuity, this API will facilitate the secure
transfer of a patient's data—including their history of prior authorizations—when
they switch health plans. This will reduce the need for providers to obtain new
authorizations for ongoing courses of treatment.16
●​ Enhanced Patient and Provider Access APIs: The rule builds on existing API
requirements to ensure that information about prior authorizations is included in

the data shared with patients and their providers, increasing transparency and
empowering them with a more complete view of their health information.16
The projected impact of this rule is enormous. CMS estimates it will save physician
practices $15 billion and 206 million hours of administrative work over the next
decade.14 However, there is a notable tension in financial projections. The
Congressional Budget Office (CBO), in scoring similar legislation, projected that
simplifying PA could
increase federal spending by $16 billion over ten years, driven by an expected
increase in the utilization of services that were previously deterred by administrative
hurdles.69 This highlights the fundamental conflict at the heart of PA: administrative
burden, while harmful, is an effective, albeit blunt, tool for utilization control.

B. The Rise of Intelligent Automation: AI, Machine Learning, and RPA

Running parallel to the regulatory push is a technological revolution in automation.
Advanced software solutions are now capable of addressing the core inefficiencies of
the PA process with a sophistication that was unimaginable just a few years ago.
●​ Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) for Denial Prediction:

A new frontier in Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) is the use of AI and ML to
shift from a reactive to a proactive stance on denials. These systems analyze a
provider's vast trove of historical claims data, cross-referencing it with payer rules
and patient information to build predictive models. These models can identify
high-risk claims before they are submitted, flagging them for review and
correction.72 This allows staff to fix potential issues related to coding,
documentation, or eligibility upfront, dramatically increasing the first-pass
approval rate. Advanced tools, such as John Snow Labs' "LLM-as-a-Judge," are
even using generative AI to read and interpret complex denial letters,
automatically categorizing them based on their likelihood of a successful
appeal.74
●​ Robotic Process Automation (RPA): RPA employs software "bots" to mimic
human actions and automate the most repetitive, rules-based tasks in the PA
workflow. An RPA bot can be programmed to log into a payer portal, check a
patient's eligibility, extract clinical data from an EHR, auto-populate a PA request
form, submit the form, and then continuously check the portal for a status update

until a decision is rendered.75 Case studies have demonstrated the transformative
impact of RPA, with one rural hospital reducing its PA-related denial rate to a
mere 0.21% and increasing its cash flow by over $2.2 million through improved
efficiency.76
The most powerful solutions will represent a convergence of these technologies. RPA
bots will handle the mechanical "work" of the process, while AI/ML models provide the
"intelligence" to guide the bots' actions, predict outcomes, and flag exceptions for
human review.

C. The Evolving Technology Stack: From EHRs to Specialized Platforms

The technology to enable this automated future is evolving rapidly across several
fronts:
●​ EHR-Integrated Solutions: Major EHR vendors like Epic and Oracle Health

(formerly Cerner) are embedding PA automation directly into their core platforms.
Epic, for instance, offers features for real-time coding suggestions and
automated submission of PA requests, aiming to keep the clinician within a single,
seamless workflow.77 Oracle Health's open architecture and modern APIs are also
designed to facilitate integration with payer systems.78 The goal for these vendors
is to leverage the new FHIR standards mandated by the CMS rule to create a
deeply integrated, native PA experience.77
●​ Third-Party Intermediary Platforms: Companies like Availity and Change
Healthcare have built extensive networks that function as clearinghouses,
connecting millions of providers to thousands of payers through a single pipe.
Availity, which calls itself "the largest network in healthcare," claims direct
connections to 95% of U.S. health plans.80 Its AI-driven "Intelligent Utilization
Management" solution reportedly handles 80% of its PA requests in a "touchless"
manner, providing an automated response in under 90 seconds.80 These
platforms offer a way for providers to standardize and automate their interactions
with a wide range of payers today, even before the CMS rule's 2027 deadline.
●​ Specialized AI and RPA Vendors: A vibrant ecosystem of niche technology
companies (such as Olive, Notable, Infinitus, and Jorie AI) has emerged, focusing
exclusively on solving the PA problem with targeted AI and RPA solutions.76 These
vendors offer specialized tools that can be integrated with a provider's existing
EHR and RCM systems, providing a focused path to automating this specific pain

point.
The CMS rule is poised to create a "digital floor" for the industry, mandating a
baseline level of electronic interoperability that will force all payers to abandon their
most antiquated processes. However, simple compliance with the rule will not be the
end of the story. It will not, by itself, create the highly efficient, "touchless" automation
that leading technology vendors already offer.81 The competitive landscape will shift.
The advantage will no longer lie in being able to navigate manual chaos but in being
able to optimize automated workflows. High-performing payers will use the mandated
APIs as a foundation upon which to build more sophisticated, AI-driven services to
reduce provider abrasion and differentiate themselves in the market.81 For providers,
this means the future is not a single, universally simple electronic process, but a tiered
system where they must still navigate varying levels of payer technological maturity.
This technological and regulatory convergence will also fundamentally redefine the
nature of PA-related work. As automation handles the vast majority of routine, "clean"
requests, the role of the human PA specialist will evolve dramatically. They will
transition from being manual data entry clerks to becoming highly skilled exception
handlers. Their focus will shift from processing volume to resolving only the most
complex, clinically nuanced cases that automation cannot handle—those requiring
sophisticated appeal strategies, deep clinical documentation review, or direct P2P
engagement. This necessitates a complete rethinking of staffing models, job
descriptions, required competencies, and training programs for the RCM workforce of
the future.

V. Strategic Pathways to Optimization: An Actionable Framework
for Provider Organizations

Navigating the complexities of the prior authorization landscape requires more than
just incremental improvements. It demands a comprehensive, multi-layered strategy
that combines foundational process excellence, aggressive adoption of technology,
and forward-looking policy engagement. The following framework provides an
actionable roadmap for provider organizations to not only mitigate the current
burdens of PA but also to position themselves to thrive in the emerging era of
automation and interoperability.

A. Foundational Strategies (Quick Wins & Process Improvement)

Before significant technology investments can yield their full potential, an organization
must first establish a solid foundation of standardized processes and optimized
workflows. These foundational strategies can deliver immediate value and are
prerequisites for successful automation.
●​ Optimizing at the Point of Entry: The most effective way to reduce PA friction is

to ensure every request is as clean and complete as possible from the very
beginning. A critical "quick win" is to move PA-related tasks to the front end of the
patient encounter. Verifying patient insurance eligibility and checking for prior
authorization requirements at the time of scheduling, rather than after a service is
ordered, is paramount.38 This proactive approach allows staff to initiate the PA
process early, preventing downstream delays and last-minute scrambles. To
combat the leading cause of denials—insufficient documentation—organizations
should develop and implement standardized checklists and documentation
templates for their most common procedures.39 This ensures that all necessary
clinical notes, test results, and payer-specific information are gathered
consistently and submitted with the initial request.
●​ Structuring for Success: Centralized vs. Distributed PA Teams: The
organizational structure for managing PAs has a significant impact on
performance. While smaller practices may rely on a distributed model where
various staff members handle PAs, a growing body of evidence and expert opinion
supports the creation of a centralized, dedicated prior authorization team.5
Centralization builds deep institutional knowledge and expertise. A dedicated
team becomes fluent in the nuances of different payers, procedures, and appeal
strategies, leading to greater efficiency and higher approval rates. This structure
also creates a single, accountable point of contact for the organization's PA
operations. This centralization creates a "dividend" that extends beyond mere
efficiency. A dedicated team becomes a hub of competitive intelligence,
systematically collecting data on payer behavior. This team can identify which
payers have the highest denial rates, which procedures are most frequently
challenged, and which appeal tactics are most successful. This transforms the PA
team from a simple administrative cost center into a strategic intelligence unit
that can provide invaluable data to inform RCM strategy, guide payer contract
negotiations, and even influence clinical service line planning.
●​ Investing in Human Capital: The ROI of Staff Specialization and Training:
Regardless of the organizational model, investing in staff is critical. The role of the

Prior Authorization Specialist is an emerging and vital profession.87 These
specialists are not merely data entry clerks; they are experts who master
payer-specific rules, complex coding requirements, and clinical documentation
guidelines. Outsourcing to or developing these specialists internally can
dramatically improve approval rates and streamline claim processing.87
Comprehensive and ongoing training is essential. Well-trained staff can navigate
complex requirements more efficiently, reduce costly errors, prevent revenue loss
from avoidable denials, and ultimately experience higher job satisfaction and
morale by mastering a challenging but critical function.84

B. Advanced Technological Interventions

With a solid process foundation in place, organizations can then leverage technology
to achieve transformative gains in efficiency and effectiveness.
●​ Embracing End-to-End Automation: The strategic goal should be to automate

the entire PA lifecycle, from initiation to resolution. This involves a multi-pronged
technology strategy:
○​ Leverage Core Systems and Platforms: Organizations should first maximize
the capabilities of their existing systems. This means fully utilizing the PA
modules and workflow tools within their EHR, such as those offered by Epic
and Oracle Health.77 For broader connectivity, partnering with a third-party
intermediary platform like Availity can provide a single, standardized
connection to a vast network of payers, effectively centralizing interactions
even before the CMS rule takes full effect.80
○​ Implement RPA and AI: To reach the highest levels of automation,
organizations should deploy Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to handle the
high-volume, repetitive "work" of PA management—tasks like checking
eligibility, populating forms, and monitoring status.75 This should be coupled
with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to provide the
"intelligence"—predicting the likelihood of denial, analyzing clinical
documentation for completeness, and identifying the root causes of recurring
denials.72
●​ Instituting Data-Driven Performance Management: An organization cannot
manage what it does not measure. High-performing organizations establish and
rigorously monitor a set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to track the health
of their PA process.84 Essential metrics include:

○​
○​
○​
○​
○​

Turnaround Time (TAT) from request to decision.
First-Pass Approval Rate.
Denial Rate (broken down by payer, service line, and reason).
Appeal Rate and Appeal Success Rate.
Staff productivity (authorizations processed per FTE).​
This data should be used to "follow the money," prioritizing process
improvement and automation efforts on the high-volume, high-revenue, or
high-denial services where the return on investment will be greatest.86

C. Forward-Looking Policy and Advocacy

Finally, provider organizations must engage proactively with payers and policymakers
to shape a more rational PA environment for the future.
●​ Championing "Gold-Carding" Programs: "Gold card" programs, which exempt

physicians with a proven track record of high approval rates from PA requirements
for certain services, are one of the most promising avenues for reducing
administrative burden. Several states, including Texas and Michigan, have enacted
gold-card legislation, and some payers, like UnitedHealthcare, have implemented
their own national programs.32 However, adoption remains low, with only 10% of
physicians reporting that they contract with a plan offering such a program.17
Provider organizations must meticulously track their own approval rate data to
demonstrate their eligibility for these programs and proactively advocate with
their payer partners for their creation and expansion.2
●​ Pursuing Strategic Payer Collaboration: While the provider-payer relationship
is often adversarial, strategic collaboration can yield mutual benefits. By using the
performance data gathered from internal KPI tracking, providers can approach
payers with a data-driven business case for process improvement. Demonstrating
how a payer's specific policies are creating unnecessary denials, delays, and
appeals can open the door to collaborative problem-solving. Aligning on the use
of shared, evidence-based clinical guidelines can also build trust and reduce
friction.82
●​ Preparing for the CMS Mandates: A Strategic Roadmap for 2025 and
Beyond: The CMS Interoperability and Prior Authorization Final Rule is not a
distant concern; it requires immediate strategic planning. Organizations should
begin now to:
1.​ Conduct a Technology Assessment: Evaluate current technology

capabilities and begin engaging with EHR and third-party vendors to develop
a clear roadmap for API implementation ahead of the 2027 deadline.
2.​ Redesign Internal Workflows: Proactively redesign PA workflows to align
with the faster turnaround times and automated data exchange the rule will
enable.
3.​ Develop a Staff Retraining Plan: Create a plan to upskill the PA workforce,
preparing for the fundamental shift from manual data processors to skilled
exception handlers and analysts.
The ultimate strategic goal, enabled by this convergence of process, technology, and
regulation, is to fundamentally redefine the prior authorization experience. The future
state is not simply a faster version of the current transactional model. It is a proactive
and personalized system where the PA process effectively disappears into the
background of the clinical workflow. At the moment a service is ordered, the
provider's EHR should be able to query a payer's API in real-time, use AI to instantly
determine if a PA is needed and assemble the required documentation, and receive an
automated approval in seconds. Achieving this vision will eliminate one of the greatest
sources of friction in modern healthcare, allowing providers to reclaim billions of
dollars in lost revenue and countless hours of wasted time, and—most importantly—to
restore their focus to the timely and effective care of their patients.
