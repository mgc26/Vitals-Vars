# Prior Authorization Part 1: The Provider's Playbook for Same-Day Approvals

**TL;DR**  
Prior authorization delays cost the average hospital $2-4M annually in abandoned procedures and staff overhead. With denial rates hitting 15% and turnaround times stretching to 5 days, patients give up and revenue walks out the door. But leading providers are flipping the script‚Äîachieving 80% same-day approvals using smart workflows, real-time checking, and strategic automation. This is Part 1 of our mini-series, focusing on what providers can control. Our toolkit provides the SQL queries, denial predictors, and implementation guides to transform your prior auth process in just 2-4 weeks.

## The View from the Provider Side

[Opening hook about provider frustrations - to be written after research]

---

*It's January. New insurance year, new prior auth requirements, same old delays. Your schedulers are drowning in auth requests, your physicians are furious about peer-to-peers, and patients are abandoning care after waiting days for approval. But what if the problem isn't the payers‚Äîit's how we're playing the game?*
