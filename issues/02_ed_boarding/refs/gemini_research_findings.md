# Gemini Research Findings: ED Boarding Crisis

## Current State of ED Boarding Crisis (2024-2025)

### Key Statistics and Trends
- **Increased Wait Times:** 20% of ED encounters for patients 65+ exceeded 8 hours in 2024 (up from 12% in 2017)
- **Admission Delays:** 36% of admitted older adults wait over 3 hours for an inpatient bed (up from 22% in 2017)
- **ED Volume:** Approximately 139.8 million ED visits in 2024
- **Bed Capacity Crisis:** Staffed hospital beds decreased from 802,000 (May 2023) to 674,000 (April 2024)
- **Behavioral Health Impact:** Behavioral health patients wait up to 3x longer than medical patients for placement
- **Median Boarding Time:** 6.9 hours in 2022 (90th percentile: 17.4 hours)
- **Psychiatric Boarding:** 90th percentile ~20 hours in 2019, now often measured in days

### Future Projections
- **2025 Inpatient Utilization:** Expected to increase by 5%
- **10-Year Outlook:** Inpatient days projected to increase by 10%
- **ED Volume Growth:** 5% growth over next 10 years, with 28% increase in patients 65+
- **National Occupancy Rate:** Projected to reach unsafe 85% level by 2032

### Impact on Operations
- **Patient Safety:** Increased mortality, medical errors, and care delays
- **Financial Strain:** Daily cost of boarded patient nearly double that of inpatient
- **System Overload:** EDs overwhelmed, healthcare safety net strained

## Root Causes Beyond Discharge Delays

### 1. Staffing Shortages
- Critical lack of healthcare staff, especially nurses
- Physical beds available but insufficient staff for safe patient care
- Prevents transfers from ED even when beds exist

### 2. Behavioral Health Challenges
- Severe shortage of inpatient psychiatric beds
- Patients held in ED for days/weeks awaiting placement
- Complex social needs complicate placement
- Limited step-down facilities

### 3. Post-Acute Care Capacity
- Bottlenecks in skilled nursing facilities and rehabilitation centers
- Authorization delays
- Keeps patients in hospital beds longer than necessary

### 4. Hospital Throughput Issues
- Most hospitals operate at/near full capacity
- Financial incentives favor elective surgeries over ED admissions
- Competition for limited inpatient beds
- Increasing patient complexity strains resources

## Best Practices from High-Performing Hospitals

### Operational Strategies
1. **Dedicated Discharge Teams**
   - RN, Case Manager, Transporter focused on discharges
   - 47% reduction in boarding hours achieved

2. **Physician in Triage (PIT)**
   - Earlier patient assessment
   - Reduced wait times
   - Improved care for time-sensitive conditions

3. **Real-Time Visibility**
   - Hospital-wide dashboards showing ED boarding status
   - Automated alerts when boarding exceeds 2 hours
   - 31% reduction in boarding with alerts

4. **Surgical Schedule Smoothing**
   - Level elective surgeries throughout week
   - Avoids predictable admission peaks

5. **Observation Units**
   - Short-term monitoring without full admission
   - Decompresses ED

### Process Improvements
1. **Early Discharge Focus**
   - "Discharge by Noon" initiatives
   - Discharge planning begins at admission
   - Morning huddles: "Who can leave by noon?"
   - Priority queues for pharmacy and transport

2. **Data-Driven Management**
   - Measure "discharge lag" (average 5 hours)
   - Identify predictable patterns (Monday/Tuesday morning peaks)
   - Predictive modeling for next-day discharges

### Measurable Outcomes
- **Financial:** $300K+ savings for 200-bed hospital, $485K revenue capture
- **Quality:** Double-digit patient satisfaction increases, LWBS reduced from 4.2% to 2.8%
- **Staffing:** 18% reduction in ED nurse turnover

## Regulatory Environment

### Current CMS Measures
- **Discontinued:** ED-2 (admission decision to departure time)
- **Active:** OP-18 (arrival to departure for discharged patients), LWBS rates
- **Proposed:** Equity of Emergency Care Capacity and Quality (ECCQ) eCQM

### ECCQ Components
- Boarding >4 hours after admission decision
- Total ED stay >8 hours
- Wait >1 hour for treatment space
- Leaving without medical screening exam

### Financial Landscape
- Currently weak financial incentives
- Push for stronger penalties/incentives tied to ED throughput
- CMS evaluating reimbursement policies that may contribute to boarding

## Emerging Trends and Future Directions

   - Virtual urgent care diversion
   - Tele-psychiatry for behavioral health

3. **Operational Innovation**
   - Flexible bed management vs. rigid designations
   - Hospital-at-home programs
   - Discharge lounges
   - Weekend surgical schedules

4. **Policy Evolution**
