# Executive Summary: Emergency Department Boarding Crisis

## Overview

Emergency Department (ED) boarding – keeping admitted patients in the ED while awaiting an inpatient bed – has reached crisis levels in U.S. hospitals. Median boarding times for admitted patients climbed to ~6.9 hours in 2022 (90th percentile ~17.4 hours) – a **32–47% increase** since 2019. These delays drive up risks and costs: boarded patients suffer higher mortality (e.g. 4.5% vs 2.5% when ED stays exceed 12 hours), more medical errors, and nearly double the **left-without-being-seen** (LWBS) rate. Boarding also incurs financial strain – one estimate pegs excess ED crowding costs at **$6.8 million** over 3 years – and looming regulatory penalties may soon hit hospitals with prolonged boarding times.

This report explores the boarding problem through a data and machine-learning lens: quantifying its impact, analyzing root causes (from bed shortages to discharge bottlenecks), and highlighting how analytics and AI interventions (predictive models, "command center" dashboards, elective-surgery smoothing, etc.) can help. We distill lessons learned (data quality, equity pitfalls, clinician buy-in) and outline **actionable steps** – quick-win pilots any hospital executive can deploy within 6 months – to start alleviating ED boarding using data-driven strategies.

## 1. The Boarding Problem in Numbers

### 1.1 National Snapshot

Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, ED crowding was a growing concern; by 2019 the national median ED boarding time (admit decision to inpatient bed) hovered around 5–6 hours. The pandemic then exacerbated these delays despite lower ED volumes. In a study of 111 EDs across 18 states, **median boarding for admitted patients rose to 6.9 hours in 2022 (90th percentile: 17.4 hours)** – a sharp increase from 5.2 hours (90th: 11.7) in 2019. In other words, 10% of admissions waited **~17+ hours** in the ED for a bed.

Psychiatric patients fared worst: among ED patients requiring psychiatric admission, 90th-percentile boarding times spiked from ~20 hours in 2019 to **over 24 hours** in 2022. Survey data underscore how pervasive the issue is: **97% of emergency physicians** report boarding times now routinely exceed 24 hours for patients in their ED. Behavioral health cases are disproportionately affected – for example, in Massachusetts, roughly **38% of ED visits for mental health** result in ≥12-hour boarding, versus ~8% of non-behavioral visits.

Compounding matters, inpatient capacity has not kept pace with population needs. The U.S. population doubled since 1945, yet total hospital inpatient beds actually *decreased* (from ~1.3 million to ~920,000), leaving **fewer beds per capita** and a tighter bottleneck at the ED–hospital interface.

### 1.2 Impact on Outcomes & Cost

Boarding's toll on quality and safety is well documented. As ED boarding times increase, so do adverse events: one review found delays in care contribute to **higher in-hospital mortality** in a near-linear fashion. For critically ill patients, boarding in the ED is especially dangerous – ICU mortality climbed from **37.6% to 52–57%** as ED boarding extended from immediate transfer to 18–24+ hours in one study.

Even for less critical patients, boarding beyond a few hours correlates with **longer total hospital length of stay** and more 30-day readmissions. Patients themselves feel the impact: those who endure ≥24 hours of boarding report significantly higher dissatisfaction with care and are **1.8× more likely to perceive discrimination** compared to patients boarded under 4 hours – exacerbating equity concerns.

Financially, boarding strains ED operations and hospital revenue. Crowding forces some patients to leave without care (LWBS rates jumped **86%** from 2.9% to 5.4% during 2019–2022, meaning lost revenue and potential harm in the community). Throughput slowdowns reduce ED capacity for new emergencies, effectively "leaking" demand to competitors. In monetary terms, excessive ED crowding has been estimated to add **$6.8 million in costs over 3 years** (e.g. via staffing inefficiencies, additional downstream complications).

Hospitals are also facing external pressure: regulators and payers have signaled that persistently long ED boarding times may trigger **financial penalties** (e.g. CMS considering conditions of participation that mandate boarding mitigation plans, and some proposals tying a small percentage of reimbursement to ED throughput performance). In short, ED boarding isn't just an inconvenience – it's a quantifiable threat to patient outcomes and hospital finances.

## 2. What Fuels Boarding?

Boarding arises from a complex interplay of **structural, operational, and patient-level factors**. At its core, ED boarding reflects a hospital throughput imbalance: incoming patients requiring admission outstrip the availability of ready inpatient beds (or staffed beds). But numerous upstream and downstream drivers contribute to this imbalance:

### 2.1 Inpatient Bed Availability & Hospital Occupancy

Simply put, when hospital occupancy exceeds about **85%**, the odds of prolonged ED boarding skyrocket. A 2022 study in JAMA found that in months when hospitals ran >85% occupancy, **88.9% of those months saw ED boarding times breach the 4-hour safe standard**, along with heightened safety risks (more errors, privacy issues, and mortality). Many U.S. hospitals routinely operate at or near this threshold, especially larger academic centers which often run 90%+ occupancy.

### 2.2 Staffing Shortages

Physical beds sit empty due to nursing shortages—you can't admit without staff. The nursing shortage has created a situation where hospitals have physical bed capacity but lack the staff to safely care for patients in those beds.

### 2.3 Discharge Inefficiency

Studies document 2-4 hour median delays between discharge order and actual departure. This includes delays in:
- Pharmacy medication preparation
- Transportation arrangements
- Family coordination
- Post-acute care placement

### 2.4 Post-Acute Bottlenecks

SNF and rehab placement delays trap patients who no longer need acute care. The post-acute care system is often the rate-limiting step in patient flow.

### 2.5 Financial Misalignment

Elective surgeries generate more revenue than ED admissions, creating perverse incentives that can prioritize scheduled procedures over emergency admissions.

## 3. Data-Driven Solutions

### 3.1 Predictive Analytics

**Admission Prediction Models**: Machine learning algorithms can predict which patients will require admission at triage with 84-96% accuracy, allowing for earlier bed planning and resource allocation.

### 5.2 Physician Champions

Both ED and hospitalist leadership must be engaged and aligned on goals and approaches.

### 5.3 Transparent Metrics

Daily visibility of boarding hours and regular reporting to all stakeholders.

### 5.4 Data Quality

Ensure accurate, real-time data feeds from all relevant systems (ED, inpatient, discharge planning).

### 5.5 Change Management

Address resistance through data, not blame. Celebrate wins and recognize improvements.

## 6. Financial Impact

For a typical 200-bed community hospital:

### 6.1 Basic Implementation (Alerts + Discharge Team)
- Reduce annual boarding hours by 40%: 3,650 → 2,190 hours
- Direct savings: $320K (reduced overtime and improved capacity)
- Revenue capture: $480K (from 730 additional ED visits)
- **Total Year 1 Impact: $800K+**

### 6.2 Advanced Implementation (Command Center + Predictive Analytics)
- Create 13-16 "virtual beds" through optimized flow
- Reduce boarding by 50-70%
- Enable higher case mix through improved throughput
- **Total Annual Impact: $2M+** (based on industry benchmarks)

### 6.3 Quality & Compliance Benefits
- Reduce left-without-being-seen rate from 4.2% to 2.8%
- Decrease ED nursing turnover by 18%
- Improve patient satisfaction scores by 12-30 percentile points
- Position for favorable ECCQ compliance as CMS implements new measures

## 7. Equity Considerations

ED boarding disproportionately affects vulnerable populations:

- **Psychiatric patients** wait 3-4x longer than medical patients
- **Racial and ethnic minorities** experience longer boarding times
- **Medicaid patients** face additional barriers to timely discharge
- **Elderly patients** (65+) represent 23% of ED visits and often require complex discharge planning

Addressing these disparities requires:
- **Disaggregated data analysis** by demographic factors
- **Culturally competent discharge planning**
- **Enhanced behavioral health resources**
- **Community partnerships** for post-acute care

## 8. Regulatory Landscape

### 8.1 Current Standards
- **Joint Commission**: Standards for ED crowding and boarding
- **CMS**: Conditions of participation considerations
- **State regulations**: Varying requirements for boarding mitigation

### 8.2 Emerging Requirements
- **ECCQ (Emergency Care Coordination Quality) measures**
- **Boarding time reporting requirements**
- **Financial penalties** for excessive boarding
- **Quality metrics** tied to reimbursement

## 9. Conclusion

ED boarding has evolved from operational nuisance to existential threat. But the solutions are proven, the ROI is clear, and the toolkit is ready. Three principles separate successful transformations from failed initiatives:

1. **Treat it as a system problem** - ED-only solutions will fail
2. **Embrace technology** - Manual processes can't match modern complexity  
3. **Address behavioral health separately** - One size fits none

The question isn't whether you can afford to implement these solutions. It's whether you can afford not to. Your patients are waiting. Your staff is burning out. Your competitors are moving.

## 10. Next Steps
