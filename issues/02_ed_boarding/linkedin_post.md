# LinkedIn Post Options for ED Boarding Issue

## Option 1: The Shock Value
Every hour, 10 admitted patients are stuck in ED beds across the average hospital.

That's 87,600 hours annually. At $219/hour in lost capacity and overtime.

The worst part? 73% of these patients have discharge orders written by 10am, but don't leave until 3pm.

We tested 3 interventions across 6 hospitals. Only one moved the needle—and it cost $0 to implement.

This week in Vitals & Variables: Why ED boarding is a discharge problem masquerading as a capacity problem.

Plus: Download our ED boarding toolkit with SQL queries, Python analytics, and a 90-day implementation plan.

## Option 2: The Story Lead
Monday, 7am. Sarah (ED charge nurse) texts me: "18 admits waiting. Zero beds. Help."

Monday, 10am. I text back: "Medicine just discharged 12. Beds available."

Monday, 2pm. Sarah: "Still have 15 boarding. Those 'available' beds aren't clean yet."

This happens. Every. Single. Monday.

But when we made one simple change—making boarding hours visible to EVERY unit, not just ED—boarding dropped 31% in 6 weeks.

Cost to implement? $0.

New issue of Vitals & Variables: Your ED boarding crisis isn't about capacity. It's about visibility.

## Option 3: The Data Hook
Plot twist: Your worst ED boarding happens at 9am.

Also plot twist: That's 5 hours AFTER your overnight admits.

The real culprit? The "discharge lag"—the 5-hour gap between discharge order and patient departure.

We analyzed 50,000 ED boarding hours. The pattern is predictable:
- Monday/Tuesday: 40% worse
- 7am-noon: 65% of boarding
- Post-weekend: Perfect storm

In this week's Vitals & Variables: How to cut ED boarding by 47% without adding a single bed.
