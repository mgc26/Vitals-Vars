**Title:** "Emergency Department Volume, Severity, and Crowding Since the Onset of COVID-19."  
**Journal:** Annals of Emergency Medicine, 82(6), 650-660.  
**DOI:** 10.1016/j.annemergmed.2023.07.024.  
**URL:** https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37656108/

**Key Findings:** Multi-state study of 111 EDs showing post-pandemic surges in boarding. Median ED boarding for admitted patients rose from 5.2h in 2019 to 6.9h in 2022 (90th percentile 17.4h). Also noted an 86% increase in patients leaving without treatment (to 5.4%) as crowding worsened. Highlights that despite lower ED volume in 2022 vs 2019, crowding and boarding were worse — indicating system capacity issues.

**Title:** "The impact of COVID-19 on emergency department boarding and in-hospital mortality."  
**Journal:** American Journal of Emergency Medicine, 67, 5-9.  
**DOI:** 10.1016/j.ajem.2023.01.049.  
**URL:** https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36773378/

**Key Findings:** Retrospective cohort from 17 EDs in a healthcare system comparing pre-pandemic vs pandemic (through Aug 2021). Boarding increased by 22% during COVID (adjusted OR 1.22) and in-hospital mortality increased by 16% (AOR 1.16). More patients were admitted during the pandemic period, and ED acuity was higher. This study provides a clear data linkage between boarding and mortality during a stress test of the system.

**Title:** "Boarding in US Academic Emergency Departments During the COVID-19 Pandemic."  
**Journal:** Annals of Emergency Medicine, 82(3), 247-254.  
**DOI:** 10.1016/j.annemergmed.2022.12.004.  
**URL:** https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36681622/

**Key Findings:** Survey of 43 academic EDs across 25 states. Boarding initially dropped in early 2020 lockdowns but then significantly increased beyond pre-pandemic levels by 2021. By Q4 2021, total boarding hours/month were 12,127 on average vs 8,521 in Q1 2019 — about a 42% rise. Shows how academic centers faced a "boarding rebound" as volumes returned.

**Title:** "Prolonged Boarding and Racial Discrimination and Dissatisfaction Among Emergency Department Patients."  
**Journal:** JAMA Network Open, 7(9): e2333429.  
**DOI:** 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.33429.  
**URL:** https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11406394/

**Key Findings:** Cross-sectional study of 525 ED patients in Boston examining patient-reported discrimination and satisfaction relative to boarding time. Patients boarded ≥24 hours were 1.84× more likely to report perceived racial discrimination in their care, and 1.77× more likely to report dissatisfaction, compared to those boarded <4 hours. The effect was particularly strong for patients from marginalized racial/ethnic groups regarding discrimination (OR ~2.36). This is a pivotal study linking boarding to health equity issues.

**Title:** "Race and Other Disparate Demographic Variables Identified Among Emergency Department Boarders."  
**Journal:** Western Journal of Emergency Medicine, 23(5), 704-710.  
**PMCID:** PMC9541972  
**URL:** https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9541972/

**Key Findings:** Single-center retrospective study (academic ED in the Southeast) examining boarding times by race, gender, age. Found no overall mean difference between Black vs White patients' boarding (~5.2 hours each) in general, but Black patients had significantly longer boarding among the sickest patients (ESI level I: 4.1h vs 2.7h) and among psychiatric admissions (22.7h vs 18.5h). Also, males boarded longer than females on average (5.5h vs 4.9h), and younger adults boarded longer than the elderly.

**Title:** "Decreasing Emergency Department Walkout Rate and Boarding Hours by Improving Inpatient Length of Stay."  
**Journal:** Western Journal of Emergency Medicine, 18(6), 982-992.  
**DOI:** 10.5811/westjem.2017.7.34663.  
**URL:** https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29085527/

**Key Findings:** Quality improvement project at Baystate Medical Center (700-bed academic hospital) focusing on inpatient LOS reductions to improve ED flow. Through a "Better Patient Progress Initiative" involving daily interdisciplinary rounds and pushing for discharge before noon, they achieved a 0.3 day reduction in average inpatient LOS and more than 50% of discharge orders placed before noon. As a result, ED boarding hours per patient dropped by ~2.1 hours (from ~7h to ~5h) despite increased ED volume/severity, and ED walkout (LWBS) rate fell by 32% to near 0.4%.

**Title:** "Use of Systems Engineering to Design a Hospital Command Center."  
**Journal:** Joint Commission Journal on Quality and Patient Safety, 45(5), 370-379.  
**DOI:** 10.1016/j.jcjq.2018.11.006.  
**URL:** https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30638974/

**Key Insights:** Describes the design and results of Johns Hopkins Hospital's capacity command center. Key elements: co-located teams, wall of real-time dashboards, predictive analytics, and standard protocols. Preliminary results showed the hospital's occupancy increased from 85% to 92% while decreasing ED boarding delays (i.e. they could safely handle more patients). Main goals were reducing ED boarding, OR holds, and transfer denials, all of which improved.

### 8. Hong WS et al. (2018)
**Title:** "Predicting Hospital Admission at Emergency Department Triage Using Machine Learning."  
**Journal:** PLoS ONE, 13(7): e0201016.  
**DOI:** 10.1371/journal.pone.0201016.  
**URL:** https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30028888/

**Key Findings:** Built and tested machine learning models (logistic regression, XGBoost, DNN) on 560,000+ ED visits from Yale-New Haven system. Using 972 variables (triage info + patient history), the best models achieved AUC ~0.92 for predicting admission. Notably, even a reduced model with key features (ESI triage level, medication count, prior utilization, etc.) yielded AUC 0.91. Demonstrates that ML can robustly predict admissions early in the visit and that incorporating historical data markedly improves performance.

### 9. AHRQ (2024)
**Title:** "Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Summit to Address Emergency Department Boarding — Final Report."  
**Date:** October 2024  
**URL:** https://www.ahrq.gov/sites/default/files/wysiwyg/topics/ed-boarding-summit-report.pdf

**Summary:** A report from a national summit of stakeholders (ED physicians, nurses, hospital leaders, patient advocates) focusing on the ED boarding crisis. It outlines drivers of boarding (supply-demand mismatches, financial incentives, discharge delays) and shares best practices and recommendations. Key points include boarding's impact on quality (list of harms: delays in care, higher infection risk, errors, morbidity) and identification of at-risk groups (older adults, behavioral health patients). It also calls for systemic changes like tying CMS conditions of participation to boarding plans and maintaining ED throughput quality measures.

### 10. ACEP Policy Statements & Resources (2018–2023)
**Examples:** "ACEP Boarding Policy Recommendations" (ACEP, 2022), "Emergency Department Boarding and Crowding" ACEP webpage (continuously updated), and ACEP Now articles like "Survival Tactics for ED Boarding" (Welch, 2024).  
**URL:** https://www.acep.org/administration/crowding--boarding

**Relevance:** ACEP, representing ED physicians, has declared boarding a public health emergency and provides guidelines and advocacy. They call for actions such as a CMS regulatory requirement for boarding contingency plans and retention of reporting measures. ACEP publications often share practical interventions (e.g. use of "full capacity protocol" to move boarders to inpatient hallways, or employing tele-psychiatry to expedite psych consults).

## Public Data Sets for ED & Hospital Capacity

### Nationwide Emergency Department Sample (NEDS)
AHRQ's HCUP database that is the largest all-payer ED dataset in the U.S. (roughly 30 million+ ED visits annually). It provides weighted national estimates on ED visits, including patient demographics, visit urgency, disposition (admit or discharge), etc.  
**Access:** HCUP NEDS Data Overview. (Note: Contains de-identified visit-level data; useful for benchmarking metrics like percent of visits admitted, though it doesn't directly measure boarding time).

### American Hospital Association (AHA) Annual Survey and Hospital Statistics
Yearly survey covering essentially all U.S. hospitals. Contains data on hospital bed counts, occupancy rates, ICU beds, staffing levels, etc. This is a key source for understanding capacity (e.g. number of beds per 1,000 population, trends in hospital closures or openings).  
**Access:** via AHA Data Hub (subscription) or summaries in AHA Hospital Statistics report.

### CMS "Timely and Effective Care" Database (Hospital Compare)
Publicly reported quality measures for hospitals, including ED throughput measures. Notably, it included ED-2: "Admit Decision to ED Departure time for admitted patients" (median minutes) for each hospital, and related metrics.  
**Access:** CMS Provider Data Catalog — Timely & Effective Care (one can filter for ED measures).

### State Emergency Department Databases (SEDD) and Inpatient Databases (SID)
Many states collect detailed data on ED visits and inpatient stays. For example, California's Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD, now HCAI) publishes ED visit data including LOS categories. Massachusetts' Center for Health Information and Analysis (CHIA) provides statistics on ED boarding.  
**Access:** varies by state (often public reports or requests).

### National ED Overcrowding Scale (NEDOCS) & Other Crowding Scores
While not a dataset per se, tools like NEDOCS provide a quantitative measure of ED crowding at a point in time. Some hospitals continuously calculate NEDOCS or similar scores from their operational data (inputs include number of patients, beds, admits, wait times, etc.).  
**Access:** formulas are published, and some EHRs have modules to compute it.

### Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) — HCUPnet
A free online query system that allows quick national estimates from HCUP databases. One can get statistics like national average ED LOS for admitted vs discharged patients (if available) or the percentage of ED patients admitted, etc.  
**Access:** https://hcupnet.ahrq.gov/

### Academic Data Collaboratives and Benchmarks
**Emergency Department Benchmarking Alliance (EDBA)** — a consortium that gathers ED operational metrics from hundreds of member hospitals. They publish benchmarking reports (aggregate) on metrics like median boarding times, throughput by volume category, etc. While proprietary to members, their published snippets showed pre-pandemic boarding trends improving.
