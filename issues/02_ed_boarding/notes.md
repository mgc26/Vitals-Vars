# ED Boarding Issue - Development Notes

## Status
- Created: 2024-12-27
- Updated: 2025-01-03 (incorporated Gemini research findings)
- Published: 2025-07-03
- Stage: ✅ COMPLETE - Toolkit published to public repository

## Key Messages
1. ED boarding has escalated to crisis levels (median 6.9h in 2022, up from 5.2h in 2019)
2. It's a system problem requiring system solutions, not just ED fixes
3. Evidence-based interventions work: 2.1h reduction per patient, ML achieves 92% AUC
4. Racial disparities emerge under stress (Black patients board longer for critical illness)
5. Patients boarding ≥24 hours report 1.84x more discrimination

## Data Points Validated (from Peer-Reviewed Sources)
- [x] Average boarding hours: 6.9 hours median, 17.4h at 90th percentile (Oskvarek et al. 2023)
- [x] Psychiatric boarding: 22.7h Black vs 18.5h White patients (Ruffo et al. 2022)
- [x] COVID impact: 22% increase in boarding, 16% increase in mortality (Griffin et al. 2023)
- [x] Academic EDs: 42% rise in boarding hours Q1 2019 to Q4 2021 (Kilaru et al. 2023)
- [x] Discrimination: 1.84x more likely if boarding ≥24 hours (Olson et al. 2024)
- [x] ML accuracy: AUC ~0.92 for admission prediction (Hong et al. 2018)

## Toolkit Components to Build

### SQL Queries Needed
- [ ] ED boarding duration calculator with behavioral health flags
- [ ] Discharge lag analyzer by department
- [ ] Staffing-adjusted capacity calculator
- [ ] ECCQ compliance tracker (>4 hour boarding, >8 hour total)
- [ ] Predictive boarding risk scores

### Python Scripts Needed
- [ ] Admission prediction model (XGBoost template, 84-96% accuracy target)
- [ ] Next-day discharge forecaster
- [ ] Bottleneck identification algorithm
- [ ] Command center data integration framework
- [ ] ROI calculator (basic vs advanced solutions)

### Templates to Create
- [ ] Command center implementation blueprint
- [ ] Behavioral health fast-track protocol
- [ ] Real-time predictive dashboard mockup
- [ ] ECCQ compliance tracking template
- [ ] Regional coordination framework

### Implementation Guides
- [ ] 90-day phased rollout plan (basic → advanced)
- [ ] Command center business case template
- [ ] AI/ML implementation roadmap
- [ ] Behavioral health boarding playbook
- [ ] Technology vendor evaluation criteria

## Research/References Completed
- [x] Current state analysis (20% >8hr waits, 16% bed decline)
- [x] Technology evolution (4 generations of AI solutions)
- [x] Best practice case studies (Johns Hopkins, UCHealth, McLaren, AdventHealth)
- [x] ECCQ measure details (>4hr boarding tracking)
- [x] ROI benchmarks ($40M McLaren, 12-18 month payback)
- [x] Behavioral health specific challenges and solutions

## Visual Assets Ideas
1. Staffed bed decline visualization (802K → 674K)
2. Technology evolution timeline (4 generations)
3. ROI comparison chart (basic vs advanced solutions)
4. Command center dashboard mockup
5. Behavioral health vs medical boarding comparison
6. ECCQ compliance tracking visual

## Questions Addressed
- [x] Behavioral health: Requires dedicated pathways (3x longer waits, specialized solutions)
- [x] Technology ROI: Proven returns from $800K to $40M depending on scale
- [x] Staffing impact: Major root cause alongside discharge delays
- [x] Financial alignment: Elective surgery preference contributes to problem
- [ ] ICU boarding: Could be separate deep dive
- [ ] Rural hospital adaptations: May need modified approach

## Differentiation from Issue 01
- More complex problem (medium vs quick win)
- Requires cross-department coordination
- Winter timing makes it urgent
- Focuses on system visibility vs process change

## Next Steps
1. Build AI/ML predictive analytics components
2. Create command center implementation guide
3. Develop behavioral health specific protocols
4. Design ECCQ compliance tracking tools
5. Build ROI calculator comparing basic vs advanced solutions
6. Create technology vendor evaluation framework
7. Develop phased implementation roadmap
