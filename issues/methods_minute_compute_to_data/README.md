# Methods Minute: The Compute-to-Data Rail
## Leapfrogging Healthcare's Interoperability Paradigm

*60-second insight for healthcare operations leaders*

### The Old Rail: Moving Data to Compute
For decades, healthcare IT has operated like a freight train system - hauling massive data payloads between systems. We extract, transform, load. We build interfaces. We create copies. We move petabytes to run simple queries.

**The cost?** 
- 73% of hospital data integration projects exceed budget
- Average health system maintains 1,400+ interfaces
- 6-18 month timelines for new data connections
- HIPAA exposure multiplies with every data movement

### The New Rail: Moving Compute to Data
What if we flipped the paradigm? Instead of moving data to where computation happens, we bring lightweight compute functions directly to where data lives.

**The Compute-to-Data Model:**
```
Traditional: [Data Source] → [ETL] → [Data Warehouse] → [Analytics]
    Risk: High | Time: Months | Cost: $$$

Compute-to-Data: [Data Source] ← [Secure Compute Function]
    Risk: Low | Time: Days | Cost: $
```

### Real-World Example: Readmission Risk Scoring
**Old Way:** 
1. Extract 5 years of patient data (500GB)
2. Move to analytics environment
3. Run ML model
4. Push results back
5. Timeline: 8 weeks

**Compute-to-Data Way:**
1. Deploy 50KB risk scoring function to EHR
2. Process data in-place
3. Return only risk scores
4. Timeline: 2 days

### The Leapfrog Opportunity
Just as developing nations skipped landlines for mobile networks, healthcare can skip traditional integration for compute-to-data architectures.

**Key Technologies Enabling This Shift:**
- **Federated Learning**: Train models without moving patient data
- **Edge Computing**: Process at point of care
- **Secure Enclaves**: Protected computation environments
- **WebAssembly**: Universal, sandboxed compute runtime

### Implementation Quick Win
Start with a pilot:
1. **Pick a high-value, low-risk use case** (e.g., quality measure calculation)
2. **Deploy compute function to one data source**
3. **Measure: time-to-insight, data exposure, cost reduction**
4. **Scale horizontally, not vertically**

### The Bottom Line
Compute-to-data isn't just a technical shift - it's a strategic advantage. Organizations implementing this approach report:
- 85% reduction in integration timelines
- 90% fewer data privacy incidents  
- 60% lower infrastructure costs
- Real-time insights vs. batch processing delays

**The rails are being laid. The question isn't whether to board this train, but how quickly you can switch tracks.**
