# Development Notes: Methods Minute - Compute-to-Data

## Key Concept
This Methods Minute introduces the paradigm shift from traditional ETL (moving data to compute) to compute-to-data (moving compute functions to where data lives).

## Core Message
Healthcare organizations can leapfrog traditional interoperability challenges by adopting compute-to-data architectures, similar to how developing nations skipped landlines for mobile networks.

## Key Statistics Used
- 73% of hospital data integration projects exceed budget
- Average health system maintains 1,400+ interfaces  
- 6-18 month timelines for new data connections
- 85% reduction in integration timelines with compute-to-data
- 90% fewer data privacy incidents
- 60% lower infrastructure costs

## Visual Elements
- ASCII-based architecture diagrams comparing traditional vs compute-to-data approaches
- Clear before/after flow diagrams
- Side-by-side comparison tables

## Target Audience
- Healthcare IT leaders
- Chief Data Officers
- Enterprise architects
- Integration teams
- Security officers

## Call to Action
Start with a pilot - pick one high-value, low-risk use case and prove the concept in 4 weeks.

## Follow-up Topics
- Federated learning in healthcare
- Edge computing at point of care
- FHIR-based compute functions
- Real-world case studies
