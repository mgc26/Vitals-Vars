# C2DR Briefing: Key Facts & Hard-Hitting Insights

This briefing provides a summary of the key findings from the Compute-to-Data Rail (C2DR) research dossier.

## Key Facts

*   **What it is:** C2DR is a new interoperability architecture where encrypted computations are sent to secure data enclaves, and only the results are returned. **Protected Health Information (PHI) never moves.**
*   **Technical Viability:** C2DR is technically viable for implementation in 2025 due to the emergence of specialized hardware (ASICs) that accelerate performance by up to **2,991x** compared to traditional CPUs.[^1]
*   **Economic Impact:** C2DR offers a **70% reduction in Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)** compared to traditional FHIR/HL7 interoperability, with a projected **142% IRR** and an 8.2-month payback period.[^2]
*   **Clinical Workflow:** C2DR can reduce nursing documentation time by **18.5%** (30 minutes per shift) and reduce alert fatigue by **50%**.[^3]
*   **Regulatory Compliance:** C2DR's "privacy by design" model aligns with HIPAA's "Minimum Necessary" principle and exceeds its technical safeguard requirements. It also has a clear path for compliance with Information Blocking rules.
*   **Pilot Program:** A $450,000 pilot program is proposed with 2 hospitals and 1 payer to demonstrate the value of C2DR in automating prior authorization.[^2]

## Hard-Hitting Insights

*   **The "Why Now":** The healthcare AI market is projected to grow from $27.59B in 2024 to **$674.19B in 2034**.[^4] C2DR is the future-proof infrastructure needed to power this growth while maintaining data privacy.
*   **The Cost of Doing Nothing:** Traditional interoperability is a major cost center, with some hospitals spending **40% of their IT budget** on data interfaces. C2DR can cut this in half.[^2]
*   **The Security Imperative:** With only **38% of US hospitals** sending summary of care documents to most or all external ambulatory care providers, C2DR's "PHI never moves" model is a game-changer for security and compliance.[^5]
*   **The Clinician Benefit:** C2DR is not just an IT project. By reducing documentation burden and alert fatigue, it directly addresses two of the biggest drivers of clinician burnout.
*   **The First-Mover Advantage:** The C2DR market is still nascent, with key players like NVIDIA, Microsoft, and Google just beginning to offer comprehensive solutions. Early adopters have a significant opportunity to gain a competitive advantage.
*   **The Path to Adoption:** While the technology is ready, successful implementation will require a focus on clinical workflow integration, phased rollouts with physician champions, and clear communication of the ROI to all stakeholders.
