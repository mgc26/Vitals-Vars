## Option 1: The Money Angle (650 chars)

Surgeons late again? Those "just 15 minutes" add up to $1.5M a year in wasted OR time.

In Issue #1 of Vitals & Variables we unpack why 52% of first-case delays trace back to surgeon tardinessâ€”and how hospitals like Yale and MetroHealth clawed back the morning with huddles, scoreboards, and tiny bonuses.

You'll get a 6-step playbook, ROI math your CFO can't ignore, Python code for a run chart, plus a GitHub repo stuffed with mock data and SQL templates.

## Option 2: The Problem-Solution (650 chars)

Your 7:30 first case started at 7:47. Again.

Nationally, only 65% of first OR cases start on time. The other 35%? They're torching $22-150 per minute while patients wait and staff scramble.

But here's what works: Yale boosted their first-case on-time starts from 62% to 77% with one dedicated nurse and text nudges. MetroHealth saw 57% improvement using $1-2K surgeon bonuses.

Issue #1 of Vitals & Variables breaks down the exact playbook, with ready-to-run SQL queries and Python analysis code.

## Option 3: The Peer Pressure (650 chars)

That OR dashboard in your surgeon lounge? Time to make it personal.

Top performers hit 90% first-case on-time starts. The average? 65%. If you're below 85%, you're leaving money and capacity on the table.

In Vitals & Variables Issue #2, I break down how to move the needle:
â€¢ Text alerts at T-30 (simple but works)
â€¢ Public scorecards (peer pressure is powerful)  
â€¢ Night-before room checks (no more 7:28 scrambles)
â€¢ Dedicated first-case nurse (ROI in 6 weeks)

Plus: SQL queries to pull your data and Python code to track progress.
