## Implementation Sequence

### Day 1
1. Run SQL queries to establish baseline
2. Print and distribute evening checklist
3. Brief evening shift on checklist use

### Day 2
1. Review completed checklists from night before
2. Note any delay reductions
3. Schedule huddle training for Day 3

### Day 3
1. Train huddle participants (15 minutes)
2. Run first huddle (keep to 8 minutes!)
3. Post results from morning

### Week 1
1. Daily huddles at 7:00 AM
2. Evening checklists every night
3. Track metrics in Excel dashboard

### Week 2
1. Implement patient callbacks
2. Review week 1 metrics
3. Celebrate wins, address gaps

## Customization Required

### For SQL Queries:
- Replace table names with your system's names
- Adjust time calculation functions for your database
- Modify business rules (e.g., "on-time" definition)

### For Checklists:
- Add room-specific equipment
- Include your facility's specific requirements
- Adjust timing for your schedule

### For Huddle:
- Adjust room count
- Add facility-specific focus areas
- Modify distribution list

## Success Metrics

Track these KPIs weekly:
1. **On-time start rate** (target: >80%)
2. **Average delay minutes** (target: <10)
3. **Severe delays >30 min** (target: <5%)
4. **Staff overtime hours** (target: -20%)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**"Checklists aren't being completed"**
- Solution: Assign specific owner, post completion rates

**"Huddle runs too long"**
- Solution: Use timer, focus only on problems

**"No improvement after 2 weeks"**
- Solution: Audit actual vs. reported compliance
