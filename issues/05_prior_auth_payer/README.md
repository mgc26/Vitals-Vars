# Prior Authorization Part 2: The Payer's Guide to Provider Partnership

**TL;DR**  
Prior authorization isn't just a provider problem‚Äîit's a $6B annual administrative burden for payers too.

But innovative payers are transforming auth from a barrier into a partnership tool, achieving 70% auto-approval rates while maintaining clinical quality. This is Part 2 of our mini-series, revealing what providers don't know about the payer perspective and how forward-thinking plans are revolutionizing the auth process.
