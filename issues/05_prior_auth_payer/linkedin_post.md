# LinkedIn Post: Prior Authorization Payer Perspective

## Post Option 1: The Plot Twist

Last week, I showed how prior auth costs providers $7.9M annually.

Plot twist: It's costing payers $6 BILLION to say "no."

Prior auth: The healthcare equivalent of asking your mom if your friend can stay for dinner. Except it costs $30 per ask and nobody actually eats.

In Part 2 of our Prior Auth series, I reveal why payers are trapped in their own nightmare:

‚úÖ Why auto-approval could save 70% of admin costs (but doesn't)
‚úÖ The "utilization paradox" that keeps everyone losing
‚úÖ How one payer cut auth time 80% WITHOUT increasing costs

Plus: The Valentine's Day special - Break up with your fax machine. Download the mutual-win toolkit.

Because prior auth ROI is negative infinity, but at least it's consistent.

## Post Option 2: The $30 Speed Bump

Healthcare's most expensive joke: We built a $30 billion speed bump and act surprised when everything grinds to a halt.

That's prior authorization in 2025.

Here's the punchline payers don't want you to hear:
‚Ä¢ Average auth costs YOU $29.40 to process
‚Ä¢ Saves an average of... $11.50
‚Ä¢ That's negative $17.90 ROI per request

Prior auth: Proof that hell has a fax machine.

This week's Vitals & Variables (Part 2 - Payer Side) exposes:
‚Üí Why 75% of auths could be auto-approved TODAY
‚Üí The 3 myths keeping payers stuck in 1995
‚Üí Your "escape velocity" implementation plan

Stop admiring the problem. The solution isn't rocket science.
(Though ironically, we can land rockets backwards but still can't approve an MRI without a s√©ance.)

## Post Option 3: The Valentine's Day Reality Check

This Valentine's Day, here's a love story:

Payers ‚ù§Ô∏è Prior Auth
Prior Auth ‚ù§Ô∏è Nobody
Providers ‚ù§Ô∏è Getting Paid
Patients ‚ù§Ô∏è Not Dying

Spoiler: Nobody gets what they want.

Roses are red, your claim is denied. Please hold while we transfer you to someone who also won't decide.

But seriously - payers are hemorrhaging $6B annually on prior auth admin. That's not cost control. That's financial masochism.

Our Part 2 analysis reveals the payer perspective:
‚úì Why "denial management" is a losing game
‚úì The California model that changes everything
‚úì How to go from gatekeeper to actual partner

Prior auth: The toxic relationship nobody can quit. Until now.

Happy Valentine's Day. Time to break up with bad processes.

## Post Option 4: The Uncomfortable Truth

Dear Healthcare Payers,

We need to talk about your $6 billion administrative burden.

You're not the villain in the prior auth story. You're a fellow victim.

Spending $30 to save $10 isn't strategic cost management. It's organizational dysfunction at scale.

2024: AI can write poetry but Karen from claims still needs 47 forms for ibuprofen.

This week's Vitals & Variables delivers the payer perspective:
‚Ä¢ Why your auth nurses hate their jobs (42% turnover)
‚Ä¢ The "false savings" that's killing your margins
‚Ä¢ California's breakthrough that nobody's copying (yet)
‚Ä¢ Your 90-day transformation roadmap

The kicker? It's not broken. It's working exactly as designed.
That's the terrifying part.

Part 2 of our series - because both sides deserve better than this bureaucratic hunger games.
