# Prior Authorization Delays Issue - Development Notes

## Status
- Created: 2025-01-18
- Stage: ðŸš§ PLANNING
- Target: Issue #04 for Jan 31, 2025

## Key Angles to Develop

### The Timely Hook
- January = new insurance year chaos
- Policy changes catching everyone off guard
- Perfect timing for organizations feeling the pain

### Unique Perspectives
1. **The "Golden Hour" Concept**
   - First 24 hours critical for approval
   - After 48 hours, abandonment rate skyrockets
   
2. **The Hidden Workforce**
   - 20 FTEs doing nothing but auth work
   - Opportunity cost of clinical staff on admin tasks
   
3. **Patient Trust Erosion**
   - Each delay = lost confidence
   - Lifetime value impact

4. **The Payer Partnership Angle**
   - Moving from adversarial to collaborative
   - Success stories of payer-provider partnerships

## Content Themes

### "David vs Goliath" Narrative
- Small practices drowning in auth requirements
- How to level the playing field with smart processes

### The Technology Trap
- Why throwing tech at the problem often fails
- Process first, technology second approach

### Quick Wins Focus
- Changes you can make Monday morning
- No budget required options
- 2-week transformation possible

## Differentiation from Other Issues
- First revenue cycle focused issue

## Key Statistics to Verify
- Industry average TAT (3-5 days?)

- Abandonment rate (30%?)
- Staff time per auth (20-30 min?)

## Writing Tone
- Empathetic to staff frustration
- Practical over theoretical
- Success stories prominent
- Technology as enabler not savior

## Call to Action
- Start measuring your baseline TODAY
- Pick one procedure type to optimize
- Results visible in days not months
