# Prior Authorization Delays: Turning 5-Day Denials into Same-Day Approvals

**TL;DR**  
Prior authorization delays cost the average hospital $2-4M annually in abandoned procedures and staff overhead. With denial rates hitting 15% and turnaround times stretching to 5 days, patients give up and revenue walks out the door. But leading organizations are flipping the script—achieving 80% same-day approvals using smart workflows, real-time checking, and strategic automation. Our toolkit provides the SQL queries, denial predictors, and implementation guides to transform your prior auth process in just 2-4 weeks.
