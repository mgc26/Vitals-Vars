# Discharge by Noon Issue - Development Notes

## Status
- Created: 2025-01-04
- Stage: ðŸ”„ RESEARCH - Gathering peer-reviewed evidence
- Target: Issue #03 for Jan 17, 2025

## Research Needed
1. **Current State Data**
   - National discharge timing statistics
   - Distribution of discharge times throughout the day
   - Variation by hospital type/size
   - Impact on ED boarding and patient flow

2. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - Why do delays occur? (rounds timing, test results, meds, transport)
   - Physician workflow patterns
   - Weekend vs weekday differences
   - Role of case management and social work

3. **Evidence-Based Interventions**
   - Multidisciplinary rounds effectiveness
   - Discharge planning starting at admission
   - Criteria-led discharge protocols
   - Technology solutions (dashboards, predictive models)
   - Pharmacy/transport optimization

4. **Financial Impact**
   - Cost of delayed discharges
   - Revenue opportunity from improved throughput
   - ED decompression benefits
   - Staff overtime reduction

## Key Messages to Develop
1. Discharge timing is a solvable problem with proven solutions
2. Small process changes yield big results (20% â†’ 40% is achievable)
3. Technology enables but doesn't replace human coordination
4. Focus on the "Big 3": rounds, meds, transport
5. Weekend performance is critical

## Toolkit Components to Build

### SQL Queries
- [ ] Discharge time distribution analyzer
- [ ] Barriers to discharge tracker
- [ ] Weekend vs weekday comparison
- [ ] Department/unit performance metrics
- [ ] Discharge order to actual discharge lag

### Python Scripts  
- [ ] Next-day discharge predictor
- [ ] Optimal discharge time calculator
- [ ] Barrier pattern analyzer
- [ ] Dashboard data aggregator

### Implementation Guides
- [ ] Multidisciplinary rounds template
- [ ] Discharge huddle structure
- [ ] Pharmacy meds-to-bedside protocol
- [ ] Weekend coverage optimization
- [ ] Technology vendor comparison

## Differentiation from Other Issues
- Quicker win than ED boarding (2-4 weeks vs 4-8 weeks)
- More focused scope (single metric vs system-wide)
- Clear ROI and measurement
- Directly helps solve ED boarding problem

## Questions to Address
- How to sustain gains beyond initial push?
- Role of hospitalists vs attendings?
- Impact of social determinants (placement issues)?
- Best practices for weekend coverage?
- How to handle complex discharges?

## Next Steps
1. Research peer-reviewed literature on discharge timing
2. Find case studies of hospitals achieving 40%+ rates
3. Identify technology solutions and their outcomes
4. Build financial model for ROI
5. Create implementation roadmap
6. Develop SQL/Python toolkit components
