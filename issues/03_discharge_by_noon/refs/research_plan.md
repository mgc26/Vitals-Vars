# Research Plan for Discharge by Noon Issue

## Priority Research Questions

### 1. Current State Evidence
- What percentage of patients currently discharge before noon? (need national benchmarks)
- How does discharge timing vary by hospital type, size, location?
- What is the hourly distribution of discharges throughout the day?

### 2. Impact Quantification
- How does discharge timing affect ED boarding?
- What is the financial impact of delayed discharges?
- How does it affect patient satisfaction and outcomes?
- Impact on hospital capacity and throughput?

### 3. Root Cause Analysis
- What are the primary barriers to early discharge?
- How much time does each step in the discharge process take?
- What are the differences between high and low performers?

### 4. Intervention Effectiveness
- Which interventions have proven successful?
- What is the evidence for multidisciplinary rounds?
- Role of technology and predictive analytics?
- Sustainability of improvements?
