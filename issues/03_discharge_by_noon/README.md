# Discharge by Noon: From 20% to 40% in 90 Days

**TL;DR**  
Only 15-20% of patients discharge before noon, creating a domino effect that backs up the ED, delays admissions, and frustrates everyone. But hospitals achieving 40%+ rates prove it's possible: multidisciplinary rounds cut delays by 2 hours, automated dashboards identify ready patients, and simple protocol changes unlock hidden capacity. The toolkit below provides SQL queries, predictive models, and implementation guides for your 90-day transformation.

*It's 2 PM. Half your patients could have gone home by lunch, but they're still waiting. Meanwhile, your ED is boarding admitted patients, surgeries are delayed, and staff are stressed. The solution isn't working harder—it's discharging smarter.*
