# Prior Authorization Mini-Series Overview

## Concept
A groundbreaking two-part series that examines prior authorization from BOTH sides of the divide. While most content takes a single perspective, we're providing the complete picture to help both providers and payers find common ground.

## Series Structure

### Issue #4: The Provider's Playbook (Jan 31, 2025)
**Focus**: What providers can control
- Smart workflows and proactive strategies
- Technology solutions from the provider side
- Documentation optimization
- Building the business case for investment
- **Audience**: Hospital/clinic operations, revenue cycle teams, physicians

### Issue #5: The Payer's Guide (Feb 14, 2025)
**Focus**: The view from the other side
- Why payers use prior auth (beyond cost control)
- Administrative burden on payers
- Innovation in auto-approval and gold-carding
- Building provider partnerships that work
- **Audience**: Health plan operations, medical directors, provider relations

## Why This Approach is Unique

1. **Balanced Perspective**: Shows both sides of a contentious issue
2. **Bridge Building**: Identifies win-win opportunities
3. **Practical Solutions**: Each side gets actionable tools
4. **Timing**: Leverages new insurance year pain points

## Cross-Series Themes

### Common Ground
- Both sides lose money on inefficient auth processes
- Technology can help, but process comes first
- Communication gaps cause most friction
- Patient experience suffers when we fight

### Contrasts to Highlight
- Providers see barriers; payers see quality control
- Providers want speed; payers want accuracy
- Providers focus on individual cases; payers see populations

## Marketing Strategy

### For Issue #4 Launch
- "Part 1 of 2" prominently featured
- Tease the payer perspective coming next
- Encourage payers to read for provider insights

### Between Issues
- Share reactions from Issue #4
- Build anticipation for "the other side"
- Encourage cross-functional teams to read both

### After Issue #5
- Package both as a complete guide
- Offer combined workshop/webinar
- Create provider-payer collaboration toolkit

## Expected Outcomes

### For Providers
- Understand what makes payers say yes

- Reduce denial rates by 30-50%

### For Payers

- Identify partnership opportunities
- Reduce administrative costs by 25%

### For the Industry
- Start meaningful dialogue
- Move from adversarial to collaborative
- Improve patient access to care

## Success Metrics
- Cross-readership (providers reading payer issue and vice versa)
- Social media discussion bridging both perspectives
- Requests for collaboration tools
- Follow-up content opportunities
