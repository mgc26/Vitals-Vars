## Example Post for OR Delays Issue

```
üè• Your first OR case is delayed 23 minutes. That "normal" delay costs you $2.4M per year.

After analyzing 10,000+ first cases, I found the fix is surprisingly simple.

In this week's Vitals & Variables, I break down:

‚úÖ Why Monday delays are 72% worse (and how to fix them)
‚úÖ The evening checklist that cuts equipment delays by 35%
‚úÖ How an 8-minute huddle prevents 52% of communication delays

Plus: Ready-to-use toolkit with checklists, SQL queries, and implementation guides.

## Best Practices

### Timing
- Post Tuesday or Wednesday, 8-10 AM
- Avoid Mondays (busy) and Fridays (low engagement)

### Structure
1. **Hook**: Start with surprising stat or relatable problem
2. **Value**: List 3 specific insights they'll gain
3. **Toolkit**: Mention the practical tools included
4. **CTA**: Direct link to the specific issue folder
5. **Engage**: Ask a question to drive comments

### Formatting
- Use emojis sparingly but effectively
- Break up text with line breaks
- Use ‚úÖ for benefit lists
- Keep under 1300 characters

### Hashtags
- Always: #HealthcareOperations #DataDriven
- Issue-specific: #OREfficiency #EDBoarding #PatientFlow
- Trending: Check LinkedIn for current healthcare hashtags

### Link Strategy
- Link directly to issue folder: `/issues/01_or_first_start_delay/`
- Not to main repository (overwhelming)
- Include "free" to reduce friction
- Use link shortener if needed

## Engagement Tactics

1. **Ask Questions**
   - "What's your biggest OR delay cause?"
   - "Has anyone tried X solution?"
   - "What would you add to this toolkit?"

2. **Share Results**
   - "Hospital X reduced delays by 60% using this"
   - "One OR director saved $300K with this approach"
   - "Reader implemented this and saw results in 1 week"

3. **Create Urgency**
   - "Monday delays cost 72% more"
   - "Every minute = $100 lost"
   - "Quick wins you can implement today"
