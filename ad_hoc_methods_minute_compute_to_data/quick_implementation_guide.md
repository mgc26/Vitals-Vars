# Quick Implementation Guide: Compute-to-Data in Healthcare

## Week 1: Pilot Selection
- **Identify a high-value, low-risk use case**
  - Quality measure calculations
  - Risk scoring algorithms  
  - Population health queries
- **Pick ONE data source to start**
  - Preferably with modern APIs
  - Strong security controls already in place

## Week 2: Technology Assessment
- **Evaluate compute runtime options:**
  - WebAssembly (WASM) for universal deployment
  - Docker containers for isolated execution
  - Serverless functions (AWS Lambda, Azure Functions)
  - Secure enclaves (Intel SGX, AWS Nitro)
- **Security framework requirements:**
  - Zero data egress policy
  - Audit logging of all computations
  - Result-only transmission

## Week 3: Proof of Concept
- **Deploy a simple function:**
  ```python
  # Example: Calculate readmission risk without moving data
  def compute_risk_score(patient_id):
      # Function executes AT the data source
      # Only returns risk score, not patient data
      risk_factors = query_local_data(patient_id)
      score = calculate_risk(risk_factors)
      return {"patient_id": patient_id, "risk_score": score}
  ```
- **Measure baseline metrics:**
  - Time to deploy
  - Execution speed
  - Data exposure surface

## Week 4: Scale Planning
- **Document wins:**
  - Deployment time reduction
  - Infrastructure cost savings
  - Security improvements
- **Build expansion roadmap:**
  - Additional use cases
  - More data sources
  - Cross-functional adoption

## Key Success Factors
1. **Start small** - One use case, one data source
2. **Measure everything** - Time, cost, risk reduction
3. **Communicate wins** - This is a paradigm shift
4. **Build incrementally** - Horizontal scaling over big bang

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Don't try to replace all ETL at once
- Don't ignore existing security policies
- Don't underestimate change management
- Don't skip the measurement phase

## Resources Needed
- **Technical:** 1 developer, 1 data engineer
- **Timeline:** 4-week pilot
- **Budget:** Minimal (mostly time investment)
- **Executive sponsor:** Critical for paradigm shift

## ROI Calculation Template
```
Traditional Approach Cost:
- ETL development: $XX,XXX (Y weeks × developer rate)
- Infrastructure: $X,XXX/month
- Security reviews: $X,XXX
- Total: $XXX,XXX

Compute-to-Data Cost:
- Function development: $X,XXX (Y days × developer rate)  
- Infrastructure: $XXX/month (90% reduction)
- Security: Built-in (no data movement)
- Total: $XX,XXX

ROI: XX% cost reduction + XX% time savings
```

Remember: The goal isn't to eliminate all data movement overnight. It's to prove that there's a better way for specific, high-value use cases. Success breeds adoption.
