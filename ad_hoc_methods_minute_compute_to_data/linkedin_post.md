# LinkedIn Post: Methods Minute - Compute-to-Data

## Post Option 1: The Provocative Question

Is your hospital still hauling data like it's 1999? ðŸš‚

While you're spending 6-18 months building interfaces and moving terabytes between systems, leading organizations are flipping the script entirely.

**The old way:** Move data to compute
- Extract 500GB patient records
- Transform & load into warehouse  
- Wait weeks for insights
- Multiply HIPAA risks

**The new way:** Move compute to data
- Deploy 50KB functions
- Process in place
- Get results in seconds
- Data never leaves home

One health system reduced their analytics deployment time from 8 weeks to 2 days. Their secret? They stopped moving data and started moving intelligence.

Ready to leapfrog traditional interoperability? Check out our latest Methods Minute on the compute-to-data paradigm shift.

## Post Option 2: The Story Arc

"We need readmission risk scores integrated by Friday."

The room went silent. Everyone knew that meant another 8-week ETL project. Another data warehouse expansion. Another security review.

But what if it didn't have to be that way?

What if instead of moving 500GB of patient data, we moved a 50KB risk scoring function? What if data never left its secure home? What if "integration" took days, not months?

This isn't fantasy. It's the compute-to-data revolution happening right now in healthcare.

Organizations making this shift report:
âœ… 85% faster deployments
âœ… 90% fewer data incidents
âœ… 60% lower costs

The rails are being laid. Time to switch tracks.

## Post Option 3: The Direct Value Prop

Healthcare's dirty secret: We're drowning in integration projects.

- Average health system: 1,400+ interfaces
- 73% of projects exceed budget
- 6-18 month timelines
- Exponential HIPAA exposure

But there's another way: Compute-to-Data.

Instead of moving data to analytics platforms, we bring lightweight compute functions directly to where data lives. 

Real example:
- Traditional: 8 weeks to deploy readmission scoring
- Compute-to-Data: 2 days

Same insights. Fraction of the time. Zero data movement.

This week's Methods Minute breaks down exactly how to make this paradigm shift in your organization. 

Stop moving data. Start moving intelligence. ðŸŽ¯
