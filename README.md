## 📚 Published Issues

### 🆕 [Methods Minute: Compute-to-Data Rail](./issues/methods_minute_compute_to_data/)
*Leapfrogging Healthcare's Interoperability Paradigm*
- 🎯 Problem: Traditional data integration takes 6-18 months and exposes PHI
- 💡 Solution: Move compute functions to data, not data to compute
- 📊 Impact: Days instead of months for deployment, PHI never moves

### [Issue #02: ED Boarding](./issues/02_ed_boarding/)
*From 8-hour waits to 2-hour transfers*
- 🎯 Problem: 20% of elderly patients wait >8 hours; staffed beds down 16%
- 💡 Solution: Real-time dashboards, discharge teams, AI predictive analytics
- 📊 Impact: 30-65% reduction in boarding, $800K-$2.2M annual savings
- 🔗 [Direct link for sharing](./issues/02_ed_boarding/)
